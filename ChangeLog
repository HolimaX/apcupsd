2007-09-15 10:48  adk0212

	* src/win32/installer/: Apctray.ini, winapcupsd.nsi:

	Remove commented-out code.

2007-09-15 10:48  adk0212

	* src/win32/winmain.cpp:

	Misc cleanup.

2007-09-15 10:48  adk0212

	* src/win32/: balloonmgr.cpp, statmgr.cpp, wintray.cpp, wintray.h:

	Fix handle leaks when adding/deleting instances.

2007-09-10 19:35  adk0212

	* src/win32/build-win32-cross-tools:

	Update NSIS to 2.30.

2007-09-10 19:31  adk0212

	* include/version.h:

	Bump version to 3.14.2.

2007-09-10 19:09  adk0212

	* src/drivers/usb/: bsd/bsd-usb.c, generic/generic-usb.c,
	linux/linux-usb.c:

	Prefer FEATURE reports over INPUT reports when searching for
	usages. This will fix compatiblity with BackUPS LCD models which
	have present but non- functional INPUT reports. It may break
	compatibility with other models, so fingers are crossed.

2007-09-10 19:08  adk0212

	* src/win32/balloonmgr.cpp:

	Minor cleanup and spelling fix.

2007-08-28 19:57  adk0212

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in:

	Address g++ linker vs. libsupc++ differently: Default linker to gcc
	if none is specified. This avoids overriding LD= passed to
	configure since if the user asks for an explicit LD we really
	should honor it (and it's needed for building universal binaries on
	OS X).

2007-08-28 19:02  adk0212

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in:

	Remove dependency on libc++ (again). Must use gcc as linker when
	using libsupc++ since g++ automatically links against full libc++.

2007-08-25 15:01  adk0212

	* src/lib/newups.c:

	Fix race between attach_ups() and detach_ups() which could result
	in the UPSINFO structure being freed prematurely. Thanks to James
	Abbott <j.abbott@imperial.ac.uk> for running many tests to help me
	find this bug.

2007-08-23 18:43  adk0212

	* platforms/etc/multimon.conf:

	Correct multimon.conf humidity monitoring.  Problem fixed by
	Patrick Frei.  Reference:
	https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=199834

2007-08-06 20:17  adk0212

	* src/win32/apctray.cpp:

	Exit apctray if GetMessage() returns an error.

2007-08-06 20:16  adk0212

	* src/win32/winups.h:

	Use enum for application-defined messages.

2007-08-06 20:16  adk0212

	* src/win32/: wintray.cpp, wintray.h:

	Redraw tray icons politely after an Explorer crash.

2007-08-05 17:31  adk0212

	* src/lib/apclibnis.c:

	Fix bug with multi-threaded net_open() calls. net_open() was using
	a global buffer for the destination address. Yikes! Bug manifestied
	itself in apctray with multiple monitors occasionally (and
	timing-dependently) pointing to the wrong UPS.

2007-08-03 15:08  adk0212

	* src/: apctest.c, apcupsd.c, lib/apcconfig.c:

	More argvalue to its primary user, apcconfig.c.

2007-08-03 15:08  adk0212

	* src/drivers/pcnet/pcnet.c:

	Remove SO_REUSEADDR; we'd only need this for TCP. Set SO_BROADCAST
	since some platforms (Windows) seem to require it in order to
	receive broadcast packets. (Most platforms use it only to enable
	*sending* broadcasts.)

2007-08-03 14:41  adk0212

	* src/lib/apcexec.c:

	Don't leak unnecessary descriptors to child when execing
	apccontrol.

2007-08-03 13:52  adk0212

	* doc/latex/manual.tex:

	Documentation updates: Fix up udev info for modern Linux distros.
	Update Windows section for apctray.

2007-08-03 11:49  adk0212

	* src/drivers/apcsmart/smart.c:

	Wait 20 seconds before declaring COMMLOST. This is necessary when
	using a smart serial cable on an UPS with an SNMP monitoring card
	installed. The SNMP card appears to disrupt serial comms for
	several seconds when interesting events are in progress.

2007-08-03 11:47  adk0212

	* examples/smartsim.c:

	Add command help key since I can never remember what the keycodes
	are.

2007-08-03 11:20  adk0212

	* INSTALL, doc/latex/manual.tex, examples/safe.apccontrol.in,
	platforms/apccontrol.in, platforms/darwin/apccontrol.in,
	platforms/freebsd/apccontrol.in, platforms/mingw/apccontrol.bat,
	platforms/openbsd/apccontrol.in, platforms/sun/apccontrol.in:

	apccontrol cleanups: powerout and mainsback should not wall; that
	is done by onbattery/offbattery under the control of
	ONBATTERYDELAY. Also remove obsolete 'restartme' event from scripts
	and documentation.

2007-08-03 11:17  adk0212

	* src/apcaccess.c:

	Remove lots of obsolete code. 'status' is now the only supported
	option.

2007-08-01 19:05  adk0212

	* src/drivers/pcnet/pcnet.c:

	Enable SO_REUSEADDR on pcnet socket to prevent false EADDRINUSE
	after quick restarts.

2007-07-26 16:36  adk0212

	* platforms/mingw/apccontrol.bat:

	Remove duplicate line. Noticed by David P. Mott <dpmott@sep.com>.

2007-07-20 12:17  adk0212

	* examples/smartsim.c:

	Add support for simulating comm failure.

2007-07-17 18:54  adk0212

	* examples/hid-ups.c:

	Include /dev in hiddev search.

2007-07-17 18:50  adk0212

	* examples/hid-ups.c:

	Report time delta from start of program when displaying events.
	Contributed by David Fries <david@fries.net>.

2007-07-16 20:28  adk0212

	* src/drivers/usb/usb.c:

	Add workaround for broken BackUPS Pro model that returns certain
	reports encoded in ASCII. Based on a patch from David Fries
	<David@Fries.net>.

2007-07-14 13:26  adk0212

	* src/win32/: apctray.cpp, winups.h:

	Add/remove tray icons on the fly as instances are added or deleted.

2007-07-14 13:05  adk0212

	* src/win32/: winres.h, winres.rc, wintray.cpp, wintray.h:

	Add HOST field showing hostname:port to context menu.

2007-07-14 13:04  adk0212

	* src/win32/build-win32-cross-tools:

	Update NSIS to version 2.29.

2007-07-14 12:53  adk0212

	* src/win32/apctray.cpp:

	Disable autorun when last instance removed.

2007-07-01 14:30  adk0212

	* src/drivers/snmp/snmp.c:

	Fix SNMP port selection. Newer versions of Net-SNMP appear to
	ignore the session remote_port setting. The only way to override
	the default port is to include it in the peername string.

2007-06-29 18:18  adk0212

	* src/drivers/usb/linux/linux-usb.c:

	Fix linux-usb device detection bug when multiple hiddev nodes are
	present.  Fixes Fedora Bugzilla #245864:
	<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=245864>

2007-06-19 20:43  adk0212

	* doc/home-page/: index.html, index.wml:

	Update for 3.14.2-win32beta2 release.

2007-06-18 20:23  adk0212

	* ChangeLog:

	Regen ChangeLog after committing forgotten files.

2007-06-18 19:49  adk0212

	* include/defines.h:

	Change CMD* definitions to enumeration.

2007-06-18 19:49  adk0212

	* src/action.c:

	Remove unused CMDDOREBOOT.

2007-06-18 19:47  adk0212

	* src/lib/apcevents.c:

	Remove unused code.

2007-06-18 19:45  adk0212

	* ChangeLog:

	Regen ChangeLog for 3.14.2-win32beta2.

2007-06-18 19:38  adk0212

	* ReleaseNotes, include/version.h:

	Update for 3.14.2-win32beta2 release.

2007-06-17 20:19  adk0212

	* src/win32/: statmgr.cpp, statmgr.h, wintray.cpp:

	Change StatMgr::Get() to return a managed string.

2007-06-17 20:14  adk0212

	* src/win32/: apctray.cpp, statmgr.cpp, statmgr.h, wintray.cpp,
	wintray.h:

	Clean up apctray needless inlining and memory management.

2007-06-17 19:49  adk0212

	* src/win32/balloonmgr.cpp:

	Cleanup.

2007-06-17 19:47  adk0212

	* src/win32/balloonmgr.cpp:

	Gracefully handle unexpected return values from
	WaitForMultipleObjects().

2007-06-17 16:07  adk0212

	* src/win32/popup.c:

	Remove balloon notice support from popup utility. Furthermore, only
	display popup if we're on an ancient OS, apctray is not running, or
	balloon tips are disabled via a group policy. This way win98 and NT
	users will still get notifications of events, as will users not
	running apctray.

2007-06-17 15:54  adk0212

	* src/win32/wintray.cpp:

	Misc improvements: Detect self-test and set status string
	accordingly.  Include UPS name in tool tip, when we know it. Change
	status string for NIS connection errors to distinguish that state
	from COMMLOST.

2007-06-17 15:19  adk0212

	* src/win32/: apctray.cpp, winmain.cpp:

	Windows NT doesn't like the "Global\\" prefix on semaphore names.

2007-06-17 13:19  adk0212

	* src/win32/wintray.cpp:

	Fix bug where COMMLOST status transition was not reflected by icon.

2007-06-17 13:15  adk0212

	* src/win32/wintray.cpp:

	Suppress initial status balloon.

2007-06-17 13:12  adk0212

	* src/win32/balloonmgr.cpp:

	Misc cleanup.

2007-06-17 12:14  adk0212

	* src/win32/: Makefile.in, apctray.cpp, balloonmgr.cpp,
	balloonmgr.h, winres.rc, wintray.cpp, wintray.h:

	Completely rewrite balloon tip handling. Balloon tips are posted
	automatically when the status text changes. This eliminates the
	need for the clunky "Receive local notifications" setting and
	allows us to post balloons for state changes on remote Apcupsd
	instances. Introduce the BalloonMgr to work around Windows
	one-balloon-at-a-time limitation. When monitoring multiple Apcupsd
	instances it will be common to need to post multiple balloon tips
	at once. The BalloonMgr handles posting the tips one at a time and
	timing the active balloon out early if new ones are waiting. This
	way all balloons will be shown, one after another.

2007-06-17 09:42  adk0212

	* examples/smartsim.c:

	Add support for simulating battery attach/detach.

2007-06-17 08:54  adk0212

	Fix indentation.

2007-06-13 20:07  adk0212

	* src/win32/winevents.cpp:

	Reverse order of events in listbox so most recent is always at the
	top.

2007-06-13 18:35  adk0212

	* src/win32/apctray.cpp:

	Use NotifyUser when notifying about multiple instances so it obeys
	the /quiet flag.

2007-06-13 18:34  adk0212

	* src/win32/apctray.cpp:

	Prevent multiple instances of Apctray.

2007-06-13 18:29  adk0212

	* src/win32/: statmgr.cpp, statmgr.h, winstat.cpp, winevents.cpp:

	Use some STL to simplify GetAll() and GetEvents() calls.

2007-06-10 16:05  adk0212

	* src/win32/winstat.cpp:

	Fix indentation.

2007-06-10 16:05  adk0212

	* src/win32/winres.rc:

	Add refresh button to events box.

2007-06-10 16:04  adk0212

	* src/win32/winevents.cpp:

	Add refresh button list stats now has.

2007-06-10 14:03  adk0212

	* doc/home-page/: index.html, index.wml:

	Update web site for 3.14.2-beta1 release.

	* src/win32/apctray.cpp:

	Misc updates and small bug fixes.

2007-06-10 09:33  adk0212

	* src/win32/installer/: Apctray.ini, winapcupsd.nsi:

	Updates for multi-instance apctray. Remove apctray parameter
	customization option for now.

2007-06-09 21:34  adk0212

	* src/win32/: winres.h, winres.rc, winstat.cpp, wintray.cpp,
	wintray.h:

	More multiple instance improvements. Also add refresh button to
	detailed status dialog.

2007-06-09 20:02  adk0212

	* src/win32/: apctray.cpp, winres.h, winres.rc, wintray.cpp,
	wintray.h, winups.h:

	More changes for better multiple monitor support.

2007-06-09 15:47  adk0212

	* src/win32/: apctray.cpp, statmgr.cpp, winres.h, winres.rc,
	wintray.cpp, wintray.h, winups.h:

	Major rework to support monitoring multiple apcupsds with a single
	apctray instantiation. Includes basic management of monitoring
	instances. More fancy stuff to come.

	Fix timeout bug.

2007-06-06 22:06  adk0212

	* src/win32/: wintray.cpp, wintray.h:

	Shutdown status polling thread cleanly.

2007-06-06 22:05  adk0212

	* src/win32/: statmgr.cpp, statmgr.h:

	Grab lock during destruction to prevent further operations.  Also
	add copyright blocks.

2007-06-06 21:26  adk0212

	* src/win32/: statmgr.cpp, statmgr.h:

	Reuse sockets in StatMgr. This prevents build-up of large numbers
	of sockets in the TIME_WAIT state. Also implement proper locking.

2007-06-06 19:53  adk0212

	* src/lib/apcstatus.c:

	Kill FillEventsBox function and associated grunge that is no longer
	used.

2007-06-06 19:49  adk0212

	* src/win32/apcupsd.rc:

	Remove unused file.

2007-06-06 19:44  adk0212

	installer/InstallService.ini, installer/common.nsh,
	installer/params.nsh, installer/util.nsh, installer/winapcupsd.nsi:

	Move installer files to installer/ directory. There are enough of
	them now that we should stop cluttering the main win32 source dir.

2007-06-06 18:29  adk0212

	* src/win32/winapcupsd.nsi:

	Add back in the finish page with ReleaseNotes and apcupsd.org link.

2007-06-06 18:28  adk0212

	* src/win32/common.nsh:

	Increase sleep time to 2 seconds. 1 second was borderline.

2007-06-05 20:42  adk0212

	* src/win32/: common.nsh, winapcupsd.nsi:

	More start/stop rework. Add new common.nsh file to be shared
	between normal and uninstall context.

2007-06-05 20:41  adk0212

	* src/win32/: apctray.cpp, wintray.cpp:

	Fix refresh again. Pretty soon I am going to run out of ways to
	screw this up.

2007-06-05 18:43  adk0212

	* src/win32/: Apctray.ini, InstallService.ini, winapcupsd.nsi:

2007-06-05 18:39  adk0212

	* src/win32/winservice.h:

	Maintain a registry flag to indicate if apcupsd is installed as a
	service.  This used to be done by the installer, but would get out
	of sync if the user ran 'apcupsd /install' by hand.

2007-06-05 18:34  adk0212

	* src/win32/winservice.cpp:

	Maintain a registry flag to indicate if apcupsd is installed as a
	service.  This used to be done by the installer, but would get out
	of sync if the user ran 'apcupsd /install' by hand.

2007-06-05 18:33  adk0212

	* src/win32/apctray.cpp:

	When installing, only add command line parameters if they were
	supplied by the user. Do not add them when using default settings.
	Also fix bug where default refresh was 1000 seconds (should be 1
	second).

2007-06-03 22:38  adk0212

	* src/win32/: Apctray.ini, winapcupsd.nsi:

	Add custom page for installing Apctray and configuring its
	parameters.

2007-06-03 13:05  adk0212

	* src/win32/: InstallService.ini, winapcupsd.nsi:

	starting it instead of using popup dialogs during file install.

2007-06-03 13:04  adk0212

	* src/win32/EditApcupsdConf.ini:

	Add definition for edit apcupsd.conf custom page.

2007-06-03 12:38  adk0212

	* src/win32/winservice.cpp:

	Suppress service-already-exists errors when in quiet mode.

2007-06-03 12:31  adk0212

	* src/win32/: compat/compat.cpp, compat/compat.h, apctray.cpp,
	winmain.cpp, winservice.cpp, winservice.h:

	Move GetArg() to common library and use it from winmain and
	apctray.  Add /quiet switch to winmain to suppress /install and
	/remove dialogs.

2007-06-03 11:35  adk0212

	* src/win32/winapcupsd.nsi:

	Add custom installer page for editing apcupsd.conf instead of using
	a popup during file installation.

2007-06-02 23:48  adk0212

	* src/win32/build-win32-cross-tools:

	Update NSIS to 2.27 for better x64 compatibility.

2007-06-02 23:48  adk0212

	* src/win32/winapcupsd.nsi:

	for common operations.

2007-06-02 23:45  adk0212

	* src/win32/statmgr.cpp:

	Tweak spacing in GetAll() to match apcaccess format for longer
	keys.

2007-06-02 23:24  adk0212

	* src/win32/apctray.cpp:

	Add /kill command line option for shutting down apctray instance.

	Update window name used by popup.exe so it finds apctray now.

2007-06-02 18:57  adk0212

	* src/win32/: statmgr.cpp, wintray.cpp:

	Rework sprintf_realloc_append() to account for the fact that on
	Win98 vsnprintf() returns -1 if the string will not fit rather than
	the number of characters required. Argh. Also remove unnecessary
	UpdateTrayIcon() calls from wintray.c.

2007-06-02 18:22  adk0212

	* src/win32/: apctray.cpp, winres.h, winres.rc, wintray.cpp:

	Add menu option to remove apctray from registry. All well-behaved
	tray applets should have this!

2007-06-02 18:04  adk0212

	* src/win32/apctray.cpp:

	Add command line options to install and remove apctray from autorun
	list in the registry.

2007-06-02 17:34  adk0212

	* src/win32/apctray.cpp:

	* src/win32/: apctray.cpp, statmgr.cpp, wintray.cpp, wintray.h:

	Move status polling to a thread instead of a timer so we don't
	block the message loop while updating status. This fixes the
	annoying pauses in GUI response. More misc cleanups and small bug
	fixes.

2007-06-02 13:46  adk0212

	* src/win32/: apctray.cpp, statmgr.cpp, winevents.cpp, winstat.cpp,

	winevents.cpp, winevents.h, winstat.cpp, winstat.h, wintray.cpp,
	wintray.h:

	More refactoring. Add StatMgr class to handle fetching stats from
	the UPS using NIS. Kill global variables and move global stats and
	events code to their proper classes.

2007-06-02 11:12  adk0212

	* src/win32/: Makefile.in, apctray.cpp, wintray.cpp, wintray.h:

	winservice.cpp, winservice.h, winups.h, compat/compat.h:

	First step of major win32 service and tray icon code
	refactor/rewrite.  This is part of the changes necessary for tray
	icon support on Vista.	Clean up winservice and winmain. Eliminate
	lots of unused code.  Simplify code where possible. Remove tray
	icon code from apcupsd itself.	Add apctray.cpp for standalone tray
	icon module designed to gather status via NIS.

2007-05-31 20:11  adk0212

	* src/win32/build-win32-cross-tools:

	Remove OpenGL and DirectX libraries, as they are not needed for
	Apcupsd.

	* ReleaseNotes, include/version.h:

	Maybe this time...

2007-05-03 18:31  adk0212

	* src/action.c:

	Do not attempt to cancel shutdowns. Once a shutdown has been
	started there is no way to cleanly stop it and recover. Plus
	deleting the powerfail file causes killpower to be skipped, leaving
	the server shutdown and not restarted. Reported by Yvon Lafaille
	<yvon.lafaille@yahoo.fr>.

2007-05-01 20:26  adk0212

	* src/drivers/usb/linux/linux-usb.c:

	Rewrite device opening logic. The new logic works as follows:	 -
	If user specifies a DEVICE, we will open that device and that
	device	    only. There is no fallback to autodetect. This is
	generaly what users	 expect when they explicitly give DEVICE.
	  - If no DEVICE is specified, we autodetect as before.
	Furthermore, if       we lose the connection to the device, we
	prefer to re-open the same	 device again, but will restart
	autodetection if that fails.	 - If DEVICE is specified using the
	deprecated '[]' syntax, just do       normal autodetection as if
	DEVICE had not been specified at all.

2007-04-30 22:14  adk0212

	* src/drivers/snmp/drv_powernet.c:

	Disable a few CIs that SNMP cards do not support.

2007-04-30 21:37  adk0212

	Contributed by Lars Randers <lars@nstec.dk>.

2007-04-27 19:30  adk0212

	* src/apctest.c:

	Fix apctest crash. When in the EEPROM programming section of
	apctest, if you try to print EEPROM values (item 1) more than once
	during the same session, the program segfaults.  Contributed by
	Ivaylo Haratcherev <I.J.Haratcherev@tudelft.nl>.

2007-04-27 19:25  adk0212

2007-04-23 19:35  adk0212

	* platforms/redhat/apcupsd.in:

	Update to match Fedora Extras packaging:   - Add "force-reload"
	aliased to "restart"   - "reload" outputs a not implemented error
	- "status" uses the status() function to return the proper LSB
	status	    code and runs apcaccess only if the daemon is running.
	Contributed by Orion Poplawski <orion@cora.nwra.com>.
