             Release Notes for Apcupsd 3.13.x

*DEVELOPMENT RELEASE*

NEW FEATURES

  * GUI monitoring applications, gapcmon and gpanel_apcmon, thanks to
    James Scott, Jr. These are Gnome/GTK based applications. gapcmon is
    a standalone app for monitoring a single UPS. gpanel_apcmon
    integrates into a Gnome panel and can monitor up to 8 UPSes at
    once. The status of each gpanel UPS is shown with a icon similar
    to the Win32 tray icon in winapcupsd. Enable building of these
    tools at compile time via --enable-gapcmon and/or --enable-gpanel.
