             Release Notes for Apcupsd 3.12.x


Release 3.12.0 02Jan06

MAJOR CHANGES

  * This is the first release following the new release numbering scheme
    discussed last spring. The minor release number (y in x.y.z) will be
    even for stable releases and odd for development versions. We've just
    completed the 3.11.x development series, so 3.12.x will be the stable
    branch with minor bug fixes incorporated into 3.12.1, 3.12.2, etc.
    Major new features will be developed on 3.13.x and eventually 
    released as 3.14.x.

  * The non-pthreads build has been REMOVED, allowing great 
    simplification of the code. Apcupsd now requires your platform to
    provide a reliable pthreads library. All modern operating systems
    include pthreads support, so this should not be a great impact. Older
    systems may not support pthreads or may not have a reliable
    implementation. Users of such systems can continue to use the 3.10.18
    stable release, although no new features will be implemented there.

  * The master-slave function should work in this release, but will be 
    removed in the next major release (3.14.x). Please migrate master-
    slave connections to the NIS net driver. (Note that 'NIS' in this
    context means Apcupsd's Network Information Server, NOT Sun's NIS/YP)
  
  * Apcupsd now requires a C++ compiler in order to build. Only minimal
    C++ features are used (no templates, RTTI, etc.) so even basic C++
    compilers will be adequate. Again the only users impacted by this
    change should be those with very old systems.

NEW FEATURES

  * GUI installer for Win32 systems (thanks, Kern!)

  * SelfTest transfers to battery now supported by USB driver. Such 
    transfers result in startselftest-endselftest events instead of 
    powerout-mainsback and trigger the capture of selftest results.

  * apctest supports changing Alarm behavior on USB models.

  * Battery disconnect and reconnect events (USB and apcsmart drivers 
    only)

  * SNMP driver supports Trap catching which allows the driver to detect
    power events more quickly. Previously the driver polled the UPS once 
    every 60 seconds which could result in long delays before power 
    failure was recognized. In order for trap catching to work YOU MUST 
    CONFIGURE YOUR UPS TO SEND TRAPS AS DESCRIBED IN THE APCUPSD MANUAL.

  * Win32 build includes SNMP driver support.

OTHER CHANGES (See ChangeLog for detailed list)

  * Code style normalization throughout the source tree

  * Improve USB driver architecture to reduce CPU usage.

  * Rename mainsback.in to offbattery.in so default power loss/return
    actions are symmetrical.
  
  * Powerflute fixes (compile and operational fixes)

  * NIS locking fix to prevent clients from reading corrupt data

  * SNMP driver bug fixes and proper commlost event handling

  * Many documentation improvements

  * Rewrite the UPSCABLE description in apcupsd.conf to hopefully
    eliminate the common mistake of thinking the cable model numbers are
    listed in columns by type.

  * Upgrade Cygwin support to 1.5.18 (thanks, Kern!)

  * Many, many bug fixes
