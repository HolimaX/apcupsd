          Release Notes for Apcupsd 3.10.6


Major Changes this Release:

- Full kill power for USB UPSes is supported if you apply the kernel
  patch supplied by Sergey Vlasov.  See the examples directory.
- Version 3.10.6 (as opposed to 3.8.x) has device specific drivers,
  and thus can have a much smaller footprint by turning off unused
  drivers.
- There is a new networking driver that uses the NIS interface
  rather than the older master/slave networking.
- Win32 daemons work much better with a new version of cygwin.
- Using a special cable (easy to build), you can run your APC
  USB UPSes in serial mode.



Other Changes this Release:

- The rpms now build without being root.
- A number of bug fixes.
- Support for additional systems.
- Support for system gd program rather than older version we
  supply.
