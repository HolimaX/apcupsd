<sect1><title>A Simple USB Configuration</title>

<para>If you have a USB UPS, and you have apcupsd version 3.10.7 or higher,
the essential elements of your apcupsd.conf file should look like the
following:</para>

<programlisting>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ##
UPSCABLE usb
UPSTYPE usb
#DEVICE
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS standalone
UPSMODE disable
</programlisting>

<para>Notice that we have not specified a device. In doing so, apcupsd
will try all the well know USB ports.</para>

<para>
If you have more than one device,
you will need to specify each one individually. If you have a
RedHat system, and know what you are doing,
you may want a DEVICE specification as follows:
</para>

<programlisting>
DEVICE /dev/usb/hiddev[0-15]
</programlisting>

<para>If you have used the make-hiddev that is in the examples directory
of the source, you will want to specify a DEVICE as follows:</para>

<programlisting>
DEVICE /dev/usb/hid/hiddev[0-15]
</programlisting>

<para>Please use the explicit specifications of a device only if
your know exactly what you are doing. In general, it is much easier
to let <application>apcupsd</application> find the device itself.</para>


</sect1>


<sect1><title>A Simple Configuration for a SmartUPS</title>

<para>If you have a Smart UPS using the cable supplied by APC, or you 
build a CUSTOM SMART cable outlined in the cables chapter, a very simple
configuration file would look like the following:</para>

<programlisting>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ##
UPSCABLE smart
UPSTYPE smartups
DEVICE /dev/ttyS0
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS standalone
UPSMODE disable
</programlisting>

<para>Normally you would have many more configuration directives to
completely customize your installation, but this example shows you
the minimum required.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>A Simple Master Configuration</title>

<para>You have a Smart UPS using the cable supplied by APC and you want
it to act as a master for another computer, which is powered by the
same UPS. A very simple configuration file would look like the
following:</para>

<programlisting>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ## 
UPSCABLE smart
UPSTYPE smartups
DEVICE /dev/ttyS0
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS netmaster
UPSMODE net
NETTIME 10
NETPORT 6666
SLAVE slave1.mynetwork.com
SLAVE slave2.mynetwork.com
</programlisting>

<para>Note, the main difference from the stand alone configuration is
that you have specified <emphasis role="bold">UPSCLASS
netmaster</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">UPSMODE
net</emphasis>. In addition, you have specified one or more slave
machines.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>A Simple Slave Configuration</title>

<para>You have a Smart UPS using the cable supplied by APC that is
connected to the master machine configured above. This slave
machine has no serial port connection to the UPS, but is powered by
the same UPS as the master. A very simple configuration file would
look like the following:</para>

<programlisting>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ## 
UPSCABLE ether
UPSTYPE smartups
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS netslave
UPSMODE net
NETPORT 6666
MASTER master.mynetwork.com
</programlisting>

<para>The main difference from the master configuration is that you
have specified <emphasis role="bold">UPSCABLE ether</emphasis> and
<emphasis role="bold">UPSCLASS netslave</emphasis>.  In addition, you
have specified a single controlling master.</para>

<para>In this configuration, the shutdown will be initiated by the
master. It is also possible to specify BATTERYLEVEL, MINUTES, and
TIMEOUT configuration directives in the Slave machine that will
cause the slave to shutdown before the master. This can often be
useful if the slave is less important than the master and you wish
to reduce battery power consumption so that the master can remain
up longer during a power outage.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Variation on the Master/Slave Configuration</title>

<para>It is also possible to have a Master/Slave configuration where
the Slave is powered by a different UPS (or any other power source),
but is nevertheless controlled (i.e. shutdown) by the master. The
setup would be identical to the Master/Slave configuration files shown
above. The only difference is where the slave actually receives its
power. In effect, <application>apcupsd</application> does not
know or care where the power really comes from.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>A Sample Slave Configuration Using the Net Driver</title>

<para>As opposed to the master/slave mode demonstrate above, you can
turn any computer into a slave by configuring with the NIS network
driver turned on <option>--enable-net</option>. Running in this
configuration, you can use any computer with
<application>apcupsd</application> running the Network Information
Server (NIS) as the master. The slave simply uses the NIS information
to decide when to shutdown. This is a much simpler mode than the older
master/slave code mentioned above.</para>

<programlisting>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ## 
UPSCABLE ether
UPSTYPE net
LOCKFILE /var/lock
DEVICE server-network-address:3551
UPSCLASS standalone
UPSMODE disable
</programlisting>

<para>where on the <emphasis role="bold">DEVICE</emphasis> directive
you replace the <option>server-network-address</option> with the fully
qualified domain name or IP address of a machine running
<application>apcupsd</application> with NIS enabled (and normally, but
not required, connected to a UPS). The :3551 that follows the server
address is the port to use. The default is 3551, but older versions of
apcupsd used port 7000.</para>

<para>Please do not confuse this with a master/slave network
configuration that is described above. This is a master/slave
setup, but much simpler (the master does not know about the
slaves), and any NIS server, even a slave, can act as a server to a
slave that listens to it.</para>

<para>This mode works principally by reading the STATFLAG record that
is sent by the NIS (present in the output of apcaccess). The low 16
bits are the standard APC status flag, and the upper 16 bits
represent the internal state of apcupsd, so the slave can see when
the power fails and know when to shutdown.</para>

<chapter id='maintaining'><title>Maintaining Your UPS</title>

<para>If you have your UPS long enough, you will probably have battery
problems. Below, you will find some suggestions for replacing
batteries. One <emphasis>important</emphasis> note of caution: at
least one user purchased one of the non-APC batteries noted below and
found out that they would not fit into his unit. This required cutting
and soldering and other very undesirable things, so be extremely
careful in measuring the batteries including every millimeter of the
terminal connections which can cause problems.</para>

<para>Although you can do a hot swap of your batteries while the
computer is running, it may not be very satisfactory because the unit
will not know that the batteries have been swapped and apcupsd will
continue to show Low Battery.  To correct this situation, you must do a
discharge and recharge of the battery followed by a battery
recalibration using <application>apctest</application>.  At that point
the battery should be calibrated better.  As noted below, Carl has found
that it takes several discharge/charges before the runtime calibration
is accurate.  Take care not to discharge your battery too much as it
tends to shorten the battery life.</para>

<sect1><title>What Various People Have to Say about Batteries</title>

<para>Here is what John Walker has to say about APC UPS batteries:</para>

<blockquote>
<para>I thought I'd pass on some information I've obtained which
you'll probably eventually need. Besides, by writing it down I'll be
able to find it the next time. I started installing mine in
1995-1996. Lead-acid batteries have a finite life even if not
subjected to deep discharge cycles. For the batteries used by APC,
this is typically four to six years. As part of the self-test cycle,
the UPS measures the voltage of the battery at full charge (which
falls as the battery ages), and if it's below about 90% of the value
for a new battery, it sets off the &quot;Replace battery&quot; alarm,
which it repeats every day. [on apcupsd versions prior to 3.8.0, this
message is sent once, on version 3.8.0, it is sent every 9 hours -
KES]. You will occasionally get a false alarm. It's a good idea if you
get an alarm to repeat the self-test the next day and see if the alarm
goes away. If the alarm is persistent, you need to replace the
batteries, which can be done without powering down the UPS or load-you
just open up the battery door, take out the old batteries, and hook up
the new ones.</para>

<para>APC makes &quot;Replacement Battery Units&quot; for each of the
SmartUPS models, but they sell them directly only in the U.S.</para>

<para>It's best to wait until the low battery alarm before ordering a
replacement-keeping batteries on the shelf reduces their life unless
you keep them fully charged.</para>
</blockquote>

<para>And Andr&#xE9; Hendrick says:</para>

<blockquote>
<para>[For replacement batteries] You need to goto you your local
Yamaha SeaDoo shop. There are 35 AMP Hour deep cycle marine batteries
that are direct replacements. These are gel-cel and will double the
runtime and/or cut your recharge time in half.</para>

<para>Finally, here is what Carl Erhorn has to say about
batteries:</para>

<blockquote>
  <para>Hi, Folks.</para>

  <para>Well, Kern was absolutely right. The problem with my UPS was
batteries. It was unexpected though, because there was no
indication of a bad battery right up until the UPS failed
entirely.</para>

  <para>For those who might encounter the same thing, and don't know
what's happening (I didn't either), here's what happened.</para>

  <para>A week or so ago, I turned on one of my SmartUPS 700-NET models.
The load is a small dual P-III unix server (Solaris 8, X86) and a
4MM tape drive. During the normal selftest that runs when you first
turn on any APC UPS, the UPS 'freaked out'. The alarm stuttered at
about 4 or 5 beeps per second, and all the panel lights flashed
spasmodically, as if something was loose inside the UPS.</para>

  <para>I turned off the UPS and it's load, then turned the UPS on
again. This time, everything seemed fine. I booted the system that
was attached, and there were no problems. The status monitor showed
9 minutes runtime (which indicates fairly low capacity), but the
batteries showed fully charged. I began to suspect a bad inverter
in the UPS.</para>

  <para>However, Kern told me that he suspected the batteries. So I took
the UPS offline, put an old SU-600 in it's place (just barely big
enough to handle the startup peaks - I get an 'overload' lamp lit
for about 2 seconds during boot), and checked out the batteries.
They did indicate that they were near the end of life, so I ordered
a replacement set. Those came in on Friday, and after the initial
charge, a complete charge/discharge cycle to recalibrate the UPS,
and some testing, I put it back in service.</para>

  <para>Surprise! (Or maybe not?) Kern was right - there is nothing
wrong with the inverter or the charging circuit, and the new cells
fixed everything.</para>

  <para>What confused me is that there was no 'replace battery'
indication from the UPS, even when it failed, plus a fair amount of
runtime indicated with a full charge. So if you see such behavior
on one of your UPS models, it makes sense to replace the batteries,
even if there is no indication that the batteries have failed
yet.</para>

  <para>One of the things I learned during this process is that the UPS
internal calibration will lose accuracy over the life of the
battery. I always do a recalibrate when I install new cells, but
rarely do it after that, as it's time-consuming, and you really
can't use the system attached to the UPS while doing it. Since my
systems are almost constantly in use, it's a pain to schedule a
recal, and I tend to put it off. This time it bit me. I'd suggest
that folks do a recal at least once every six months. It will make
your runtime estimates much more accurate, and also allows you to
keep track of the state of your batteries.</para>

  <para>For those who don't know how to do this, here's what you do.
This proceedure should not be confused with the 'Recalibrate'
feature in the APC PowerchutePlus software. They do not do the same
thing.</para>

  <para>&gt;From APC's web site:</para>

  <para>Perform a Runtime Calibration. This is a manual procedure and
should not be confused with the runtime calibration performed
through PowerChute plus. The batteries inside of the Smart-UPS are
controlled by a microprocessor within the UPS. Sometimes it is
necessary to reset this microprocessor, especially after the
installation of new batteries. Stop the PowerChute plus software
from running and disconnect the serial cable. There must be at
least a 30% load attached to the UPS during this procedure, but the
process will cause the UPS to shut off and cut power to its
outlets. Therefore, attach a non-critical load to the UPS and then
force the UPS on battery by disconnecting it from utility power.
Allow the unit to run on battery until it turns off completely.
Make sure a 30% load is present! Plug the UPS back into the wall
outlet and allow it to recharge (it will recharge more quickly
turned off and with no load present). Once the unit has recharged,
the &quot;runtime remaining&quot; calculation should be more accurate.
Remember that if the unit is an older model, then the runtime will
not improve significantly.</para>

  <para>Background:</para>

  <para>An APC Smart-UPS has a microprocessor which calculates runtime
primarily based on the load attached to the UPS and on its battery
capacity. On the right side of the front display panel there is a
vertical graph of five LEDs. Each LED is an indication of battery
charge in increments of twenty percent: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100%
(bottom to top). For example, if the battery charge is 99%, then
only four of the five LEDs are illuminated.</para>

  <para>To ensure that an operating system receives a graceful shutdown
when using PowerChute plus or a SmartSlot accessory, an alert is
generated by the Smart-UPS indicating that the UPS has reached a
low battery condition. The alert is audible (rapid beeping), visual
(flashing battery LED or LEDs), and readable through the graphical
interface of PowerChute plus software (or a native UPS shutdown
program within a particular operating system.) In order to
calculate this &quot;low battery condition,&quot; all Smart-UPS products have
a preconfigured low battery signal warning time of two minutes
(this is the factory default setting). There are a total of four
user-changeable settings: 2, 5, 7, or 10 minutes. If the low
battery signal warning time is set for 2 minutes, then the alerts
will activate simultaneously two minutes prior to shutdown.
Similarly, if the total runtime for a particular UPS is 30 minutes
with a low battery signal warning time set at 10 minutes, then the
UPS will run on battery for 20 minutes before the low battery alert
begins.</para>

  <para>Total runtime is primarily based on two factors, battery
capacity and UPS load. UPS load and runtime on battery are
inversely proportional: as load increases, battery runtime
decreases and vice versa. When utility power is lost, the UPS
begins discharging the battery in order to support the attached
load. Once power returns, the Smart-UPS will automatically begin to
recharge its battery.</para>

  <para>My comments on this proceedure:</para>

  <para>I believe this proceedure works for all APC models that calulate
runtime, not just the SmartUPS. It's important that you load the
UPS to 30% of the UPS capacity, as reported by apcupsd or another
UPS monitor program. I've found that normal house lamps of
different wattages allow me to adjust the load to almost exactly
what I want, which is between 30% and 35% of the UPS capacity. This
is critical te getting an accurate reading (according to the APC
web documents). Always bring the UPS to 100% charge first, as
indicated by the front panel lamps, or your UPS monitoring
software.</para>

  <para>Set the UPS shutdown time to 2 minutes, all other settings to
nominal, and disconnect the serial port cable from the UPS before
running the recalibration. If you leave a monitoring program
running through the serial port, it will turn the UPS off early,
and you don't want to do that during a recalibration run. When the
run is complete, and the UPS turns off, you can reattach the serial
cable, and the normal loads, and recharge the batteries normally.
If you think you might have a power outage during the recharge
time, allow the UPS to recharge to 20% or so (indicated by the
panel lamps) before trying to use the computer system. This will
allow the UPS to handle short dropouts while it recharges. Of
course, if you can leave the computer off during the recharge time,
the UPS will recharge much faster.</para>

  <para>As an aside, when the batteries failed, my total runtime at 100%
charge and an idle state was 9 minutes, which is pretty bad. I
replaced the batteries with extended capacity cells, which add
about 15% to the stock capacity. Now, after two complete charge/
discharge cycles, 100% charge shows the available runtime to be 42
minutes on the system when it's idle, and 33 minutes when the
system is very busy. The differences are due to the load of the
computer, when the disks are busy, and the cpus are not in a halted
state (my system halts the cpus when they are idle, to save power
and lower heat, as do other OS like Linux), when compared to an
idle state. Apcupsd indicates the load is about 27% when idle, and
as much as 37% when heavily loaded.</para>

  <para>I've found that two charge/discharge cycles result in a more
accurate recalibration when installing new cells. It appears that
some batteries need to be put through a couple of complete cycles
before they reach their full capacity. I've also noticed that the
full-charge voltage is different for each battery until they have
been through two cycles. On the initial charge of my new batteries,
the 100% charge voltage on the two cells was almost .5 VDC apart.
After two complete cycles, the batteries measure within .01 VDC of
each other!</para>

  <para>I hope this information helps anyone who might encounter the
problem I saw, and also shows folks how to recal their batteries.
If you haven't done a complete recalibration in a year or two, I'd
recommend it, so that you have warning of a low battery instead of
what happened to me.</para>

  <para>Regards,</para>

<sect1><title>Where Carl Suggests You Get Batteries</title>
<blockquote>

  <para>Hi, Folks.</para>

  <para>I'm just replacing the batteries in one of my SmartUPS models,
and it occurs to me that some of you may not know about the place I
get them from. I have no relationship with this company, other than
as a customer, but I feel they know what they are doing, their
prices are fair, and they have some interesting batteries available
that you can't obtain from APC.</para>

  <para>These are the reasons I use them, and I thought this information
might be useful to the US list members. They will ship outside of
the US. If you have questions, you can contact them through the
email address listed on their web pages. They have always responded
pretty quickly to my questions.</para>

  <para>The company is called Battery Wholesale Distributors, and they
are located in Georgetown, Texas. If you have questions, you can
reach them by phone at (800) 365-8444, 9:00AM to 5:00PM (their
local time), Monday through Friday. I've gotten email from them on
the weekends, although the office is not open then.</para>

  <para>I won't post prices, as you can get current pricing from their
web site. They have an entire section dedicated to APC replacement
batteries, and it's easy to find what you need. You can order over
the web, or by phone. They accept all the usual credit cards.</para>

  <para>The web site (as you might guess) is: <ulink
url="http://www.batterywholesale.com">www.batterywholesale.com</ulink></para>

  <para>The thing I really like is that they have found manufacturers
who make batteries in the standard case sizes, but have additional
capacity over the original batteries shipped with the APC UPS
models. Often, the difference is as much as 15% or so, and this can
result in additional runtime. It's a nice upgrade for a minor
increase in price.</para>

  <para>They are also 'green-aware', in that they encourage you to
recycle your old batteries, and will accept the old batteries back
from you if you cannot find a local place that recycles them. You
pay the shipping, but I think other than that, there is no charge.
I've never done this, as I have a battery retailer just down the
street who will accept my old batteries.</para>

  <para>Anyway, if you didn't know about these folks, put the info aside
where you can find it when you need replacement batteries. I won't
make any guarantees, but I've been very pleased with their
products, service, and pricing. I hope you find them as helpful to
you as I do. I've been dealing with them since about 1994, and have
never been disappointed. The owner of the place also is very good
on technical issues, so if you have questions on their products, he
can get as technical as you need to go.</para>

<qandaentry>
<question id='crazy'>
<para>Why all the craziness with custom serial cables?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>It was nothing more nor less than a form of customer
control. For a long time APC wanted to keep other people from talking
to its UPSes so it could lock out potential competition for its
PowerChute software.  Scrambling the leads on its serial cables was
a cheap way to accomplish this &mdash; in fact, they tended to be wired so
that if you tried a straight-through cable, opening a serial link to
the UPS would be interpreted as a shutdown command!</para>

<para>(Hardware companies often think like this &mdash; they lock up
interfaces by instinct, cornering a small market rather than growing a
bigger one.  It's fundamentally stupid and self-defeating, but it's
the kind of stupid that tends to sound good at an executive
meeting.)</para>

<para>Fortunately, APC has lost a lot of this attitude since about
2000; nowadays they even release technical information to the

    <para>What UPS brands does <application>apcupsd</application>
    support?</para>
  </question>
  <answer>
    <para>Currently <application>apcupsd</application> supports only
    APC UPSes. However, some companies such as Hewlett Packard put
    their own brand name on APC manufactured UPSes. Thus even if you
    do not have an APC branded UPS, it may work with
    <application>apcupsd</application>. You will need to know the
    corresponding APC model
    number. <application>apcupsd</application> supports all the

  <question><para>Does <application>apcupsd</application> support Windows?</para></question>
  <answer>
    <para>With release 3.8.0, <application>apcupsd</application> now
    runs on Win95/98, WinMe, WinNT, and Win2000 machines. All features of
    the Unix versions of <application>apcupsd</application> are
    implemented. The UPS EEPROM programming features of
    <application>apcupsd</application> have not been tested under
    Windows. Version 3.8.0 does not support simple signaling UPSes
    (BackUPS, etc). Version 3.8.1 does support most simple signaling
    UPSes, but not all cables (due to deficiencies in the Windows serial
    port API). Please note that we have had reports that
    <application>apcupsd</application> does not work properly on the WinXP
    system. If you have any information on this, please email us.</para>

  <question><para>How much CPU resources does <application>apcupsd</application> use?</para></question>
  <answer>
    <para>Depending on your CPU speed, you may see more or less of
    the CPU consumed by <application>apcupsd</application>. On a
    400MHz Unix system, the CPU usage should fall well below
    0.1%. On slower systems, the percentage will increase
    proportionally to the decrease in the CPU speed. On a 400Mhz
    Win98 machine, the CPU usage will be on the order of
    0.5-1.0%. This is higher than for Unix systems. However,
    compared to the 30% CPU usage by APC's PowerChute (the version
    on the CDROM shipped with my UPS),
    <application>apcupsd</application>'s 0.5-1.0% is very
    modest.</para> <para>If you configure
    <application>apcupsd</application> to run with pthreads
    (<option>--with-pthreads</option> on the
    <command>./configure</command> line),
    <application>apcupsd</application> will run considerably faster,
    otherwise said, it will consume less of your CPU, and it will
    use approximately one third of the memory. For example, Carl
    Erhorn reports that on his Solaris system, &quot;With the old
    3-process version, we averaged about 4.8MB of total memory
    used. With the new single process, we use only about 1.7MB!
    That's also a very good improvement.&quot;</para>

  <question><para>We are using apcupsd-3.8.1-1 in RedHat 6.2. The slave, when
  shutting down, is reporting an error at line 436 of apcupsd.c. The
  error is initiated by <command>apcupsd --killpower</command>! What
  can we do to fix this, and is it critical?</para></question>
  <answer>
    <para>No, the error is not serious. Unfortunately, the
    documentation in the area of master/slaves is not very detailed,
    and for that reason, your slave setup is not totally correct as
    explained below.</para>

    <para>On master machines, we modify
    <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt</filename> to re-invoke apcupsd
    with the <option>--killpower</option> option (actually the
    script apccontrol is called). This causes the UPS to send the
    codes to the UPS to make it power off.</para>

    <para>On slave machines, these modifications should not be made
    to the <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt</filename> script since
    the slave has no connection to the UPS.</para>

    <para>To eliminate the problem, on all your slave machines, either
    restore the original halt file, or simply delete all the lines

  <question><para>To test <application>apcupsd</application>, I unplugged the
  UPS to simulate a power outage. After the machine went into the
  shutdown process I plugged the UPS back into the commercial power
  source. This caused the shutdown process to hang after the daemon
  tried to shut-off the ups. Have you run into this problem, and if so
  do you have a remedy?</para></question>
  <answer>
    <para>Normally, once the shutdown process has begun, we cannot
    stop it, though there <emphasis>is</emphasis> some code that
    tries to do so, we don't consider it a very good idea &mdash;
    how do you stop a shutdown that has killed off half of the
    daemons running on your system? Most likely you will be left
    with an unusable system. In addition, when apcupsd is
    re-executed in the halt script after the disks are synced, it
    tries to shut off the UPS power, but the UPS will generally
    refuse to do so if the AC power is on. Since we cannot be 100%
    sure whether or not the UPS will shut off the power, we don't
    attempt to reboot the system if we detect that the power is back
    as it might then get caught by a delayed power off (at least for
    Smart UPSes).</para>

  <question><para>After running apcupsd for a while, I get the following
  error: &quot;Serial communications with UPS lost.&quot; What is
  the problem?</para></question>
  <answer>
    <para>We use standard Unix serial port read() and write() calls
    so once a connection is made, we generally have few
    problems. However, there have been reports that APC's SNMP
    Management Card can cause serial port problems. If you have such
    a card, we suggest that you remove it and see if the problem
    goes away. It is also possible that some other process such as a
    <application>getty</application> is reading the serial
    port.</para>

  <question><para>When apcupsd starts, I get the following error:
  &quot;attach_shmarea: cannot get shm area: Identifier
  removed.&quot; What is the problem?</para></question>
  <answer>
    <para>This problem and the problem of <emphasis
    role="bold">cannot create shm area</emphasis> are due to the
    fact that the shared memory key that apcupsd wants to use is
    already in use. This happens most frequently when there is an
    old zombie apcupsd process still in the system.  The solution is
    to remove the old process.  You can often see what is going on
    by doing a: <command>ipcs</command> command as root when apcupsd
    is not running. If you see a segment with the key 0x10feed01,
    you can be sure there is some old apcupsd process still using
    it. If you cannot kill the old process, you can try using
    <command>ipcrm</command> (see the man pages).  Recent versions
    of <application>apcupsd</application> starting with
    apcupsd-3.8.2Beta6 should no longer have this problem as they
    will automatically try using a different key.</para>

  file or directory.&quot; What is the problem?</para></question>
  <answer>
    <para>The two most likely causes of your problem are:  1. You have the
    wrong serial port device name in the apcupsd.conf file.
    2. The device name is not defined on your system.
    Suggestions for proceeding:For the first item, check what your

    <para>Normally there will be hundreds or even thousands of names
    that print. If that doesn't produce anything useful, you can try

  <question><para>How do I ensure that the slaves shutdown before the master?</para></question>
  <answer>
    <para>There are several strategies for getting the slaves
    properly shutdown before shutting down the master. The first is
    to make the master wait a period of time for the slaves to
    shutdown before doing its own shutdown. Currently, the master
    always waits 30 seconds before starting its own shutdown. If
    this is insufficient, you can add additional time by putting an
    appropriate <emphasis role="bold">sleep</emphasis> shell command
    in the <filename>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</filename> file just
    before the actual system shutdown command is executed (there are
    something like 3 places). The second strategy is to put a
    TIMEOUT value in the apcupsd.conf file on the slave that is
    sufficiently short that you are sure that the slave will
    shutdown before the master. If the shutdown is done with a
    poweroff, this will also save power so that the master can stay
    up longer.</para>

<qandaentry>
  <question><para>How do I ensure that my database server is correctly shutdown?</para></question>
  <answer>
    <para>You simply add whatever commands are necessary in the
    appropriate case statements in
    <filename>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</filename>, which is a
    standard script file that is called to actually do the
    shutdown. Alternatively, you can add your own script file that
    will be called before doing the commands in
    <application>apccontrol</application>. Your script file must
    have the same name as the appropriate case statement in
    <application>apccontrol</application>; it must be executable;
    and it must be in the same directory as
    <application>apccontrol</application>.</para>

    Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly</para></question>
  <answer>
    <para>The most common error causing your problem is an incorrect
    serial port specification on your DEVICE directive. It should be:</para>
<programlisting>
DEVICE /dev/com2
</programlisting>
    <para>On WinNT machines, and probably Win2000 machines you MUST
    use <filename>/dev/com2</filename> unless you modify the
    behavior of the boot process to prevent Windows from probing the
    port. This is documented in our manual for WinNT. Although I
    imagine it is the same for Win2000, I am not sure.</para>

    <para>The second most common problem is bad placement of the
    files &#x2014; i.e. you did not install them in c:\apcupsd
    Unfortunately for the current release, this path is &quot;hard
    coded&quot; into the binaries.</para>

    <para>The third most common problem is that you did not run the
    <filename>setup.bat</filename> script after loading the
    files. This is necessary to install apcupsd as a service.</para>

    <para>If all the above fails, try starting apcupsd by hand

<chapter><title>Master/Slave Configurations</title>

<para>If you have two or more computers that are powered by the same UPS
and they are connected by a network, you can configure
<application>apcupsd</application> so that the computer that controls the UPS
(connected by the serial port or USB port), which is called the
master, can provide information to other machines powered by the
UPS, called slaves. When the master detects a power failure, it
will notify all the slaves (maximum of twenty). If the master
detects that the battery is low, it will also notify the slave so
that the slave may perform a shutdown. </para>

<para>In addition, in cases where you wish to keep the master up
longer than the slave, you can configure the slave to shut down in a
predetermined time after the UPS goes on batteries.</para>

<para>If a picture is worth a thousand words for you, please see

<sect1><title>Configuration Directives</title>

<para>If you are setting up a master/slave configuration, you will be

<sect2><title>Master/Slave Networking using NIS and the NET Driver</title>

<para>It is also possible to implement a network of master/slave
apcupsds using the new 3.10.x code and the <emphasis
role="bold">net</emphasis> driver. This mode of master/slave
networking is considerably different from the old method described at
the beginning of this chapter. In the old code, there is a lot of
configuration on both the master and slave side, and the master polls
or sends info to the slave. Using the <emphasis
role="bold">net</emphasis> driver is much simpler. However, you should
carefully check that the slave does a proper shutdown. In the
master/slave code, the master ensures the best it can that the slave
is shutdown or notified before it shuts down itself. On the other
hand, using the net driver, the master knows nothing about the slaves
that may be listening and thus takes no special precautions to ensure
that the slaves receive the shutdown signal. Since the slave reads the
master's data once per second there should be no shutdown problems,
and our experience confirms this.  This question can only  be answered
by carefully testing the shutdown.</para>

<para>In this master/slave mode, the master is a standard stand alone
configuration except that it must have <emphasis role="bold">NETSERVER
on</emphasis> in the configuration file and have an <emphasis
role="bold">NISPORT nnn</emphasis> defined. Thus any
<application>apcupsd</application> running in this mode then becomes
the master.</para>

<para>The slave then uses the net driver to connect to the master's
NIS output. In this mode, the slave decides how often to poll the
master for the NIS information. The slave copy of apcupsd, have
<emphasis role="bold">UPSTYPE net</emphasis>, which will invoke the
&quot;network&quot; driver. By setting this machine's <emphasis
role="bold">DEVICE</emphasis> to be <emphasis
role="bold">master-ip:master-NIS-port</emphasis> it will automatically
connect to the master and use the master's signals to shutdown the
computer.  In the example net slave configuration file below, the
slave uses the NIS information provided by the computer <emphasis
role="bold">tibs</emphasis> on port <emphasis
role="bold">3551</emphasis>.</para>

<sect1><title>Network Problems with Master/Slave Configurations</title>

<para>When working with a master/slave configuration (one UPS powering
more than one computer), the master and slave communicate via the
network. In many configurations, <application>apcupsd</application> is
started before the network is initialized. In this case, it is
possible that the master will be unable to contact the slave. On
<application>apcupsd</application> versions prior to 3.8.0, this could
cause <application>apcupsd</application> to error off. The solution to
this problem is to either force <application>apcupsd</application> to
be started after the network and the DNS (fiddle the symbolic links in
/etc/rc.d), or put the names of the slave machines in your
<filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file, or even more preferable, use IP
addresses rather than machine names. On some configurations, you may
need to use fully qualified names (host.domain.xxx) rather than simple
host names.</para>

<sect2><title>Error Messages from a Master Configuration</title>

<para>In a master/slave configuration, you can get the following error
messages from a master. The error message is followed by a possible
explanation:</para>

<sect3><title>Cannot resolve slave name <replaceable>XXX</replaceable></title>

<para>To contact the slave, the slave name given in the configuration
file must be resolved to an IP address. In this case,
<application>apcupsd</application> could not get the IP
address. Either the slave name is incorrect, your DNS may not be
working, or you have started <application>apcupsd</application> during
the boot process before the network is operational.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3><title>Got slave shutdown from <replaceable>SSS</replaceable></title>

<para>This message should not be printed as it is not yet used.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3><title>Cannot write to slave <replaceable>SSS</replaceable></title>

<para>This message occurs when the master attempts to send a message
to the slave SSS and gets an error. It indicates that either the slave
machine is not responding (<application>apcupsd</application> died,
the system crashed, ...) or that the network is down.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3><title>Cannot read magic from slave <replaceable>SSS</replaceable></title>

<para>This message indicates that the master attempted to read the
code key from the slave SSS and it did not match the value expected. A
common cause of this problem is that the master and slave versions of
<application>apcupsd</application> are not the same. Please be sure
you are running the same version of <application>apcupsd</application>
on all your master and slave machines.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3><title>Connect to slave SSS failed</title>

<para>This message is logged when the master attempts to connect to
slave SSS and no connection is accepted. The most common cause of this
problem is that the slave copy of <application>apcuspd</application>
is not yet ready to accept connections or is not running. Generally,
<application>apcupsd</application> will retry the connection a bit
later. If the problem is persistent, it can indicate a network problem
or the slave name on the SLAVE directive of the master's configuration
file is incorrect.</para>

</sect3>

<sect2><title>Error Messages from a Slave Configuration</title>

<para>In a master/slave configuration, you can get the following error
messages from a slave. The error message is followed by a possible
explanation:</para>

<sect3><title>Can't resolve master name <replaceable>MMM</replaceable></title>

<para>This message is logged when the slave attempts to resolve the
name given on the MASTER configuration directive to an IP address. It
probably means that the master name MMM is not defined, your DNS is
not properly working, or you have started
<application>apcupsd</application> in the boot process before the
network is initialized. Check the name MMM, or use an explicit IP
address on the MASTER configuration directive in the slave's
configuration file.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3><title>Cannot bind local address, probably already in use</title>

<para>This means that the slave has attempted to bind the port number
so that it can listen for messages from the master. This can occur if
already have a copy of <application>apcupsd</application> running, or
you have previously run <application>apcupsd</application> in the past
5 or 10 minutes, because occasionally the operating system will not
shutdown a port correctly for 5 to 10 minutes after a program
exits. In this case, you can either wait a few minutes for the problem
to go away, or use a different port in both your master and slave
configuration files.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3><title>Socket accept error</title>

<para>The slave got an error waiting on the accept() system call. This is
probably due to a fundamental networking problem.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3><title>Unauthorized attempt from master <replaceable>MMM</replaceable></title>

<para>The master named MMM (probably an IP address) contacted the slave
but MMM is not the master that was listed on the MASTER

is not authorized to communicate with the slave. Please check that
your MASTER and SLAVE names in your slave and master configuration
files respectively are correct.</para>

<application>apcupsd</application> on all your master and
slaves.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3><title>Bad user magic from master: <replaceable>MMM</replaceable></title>

<para>This message indicates that the master and slave have previously
communicated, but that the code key transmitted with the most

some other user or machine contacting the slave on the network
port.</para>

<chapter><title>Controlling Multiple UPSes on one Machine</title>

<para>You may want to use your server to control multiple UPSes. This
is possible by proper configuration and by running one copy of
<application>apcupsd</application> for each UPS to be
controlled (recall the <xref linkend='configtypes'/>).</para>

<sect1><title>Configuration</title>

<para>The way to accomplish the above is to ensure that none of the
critical files used by each of the two copies of
<application>apcupsd</application> are the same. By using suitable
configuration options, this is possible.</para>

<sect2><title>The First Copy of <application>apcupsd</application></title>

<para>For example, assuming you have SmartUPSes in both cases, to
configure and install the first copy of
<application>apcupsd</application>, which controls a UPS and Computer
A, one could use the following configuration:</para>

<programlisting>
./configure \
  --prefix=/usr \
  --sbindir=/sbin \
  --with-cgi-bin=/home/http/cgi-bin \
  --enable-cgi \
  --with-css-dir=/home/http/css \
  --with-log-dir=/etc/apcupsd \
  --with-serial-dev=/dev/ttyS0 \
  --enable-pthreads \
  --with-nis-port=3551 \
  --enable-powerflute 
</programlisting>

<para>This is pretty much a &quot;normal&quot; installation using many
of the defaults. Once built and installed, this would control the
first UPS and cause a shutdown of the system when the batteries are
low.  This copy of <application>apcupsd</application> will be started
and stopped automatically when the system is booted and halted.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>The Second Copy of <application>apcupsd</application></title>

<para>To configure and install the second copy of
<application>apcupsd</application>, which controls the second UPS and
Computer B, you could use the following configuration:</para>

<programlisting>
./configure \
  --prefix=$HOME/apcupsd/bin \
  --sbindir=$HOME/apcupsd/bin \
  --enable-cgi \
  --with-cgi-bin=$HOME/apcupsd/bin \
  --with-log-dir=$HOME/apcupsd/bin \
  --with-pid-dir=$HOME/apcupsd/bin \
  --sysconfdir=$HOME/apcupsd/bin \
  --with-lock-dir=$HOME/apcupsd/bin \
  --with-pwrfail-dir=$HOME/apcupsd/bin \
  --with-serial-dev=/dev/ttyS1 \
  --enable-pthreads \
  --with-nis-port=7001 \
  --disable-install-distdir
</programlisting>

<para>Note, in this case, we use considerably more configuration options
to ensure that the system files are placed in a different directory
(<filename>$HOME/apcupsd/bin</filename>). We have also selected a different serial port
and a different NIS (Network Information Server) port. And finally,
we have used the <option>--disable-install-distdir</option> option, which
prevents <command>make install</command> from doing the final system
installation (i.e. the modification of the halt script) since this
was previously done.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Important Steps after Installation of the Second Copy</title>

<para>After the <command>make install</command> of the second copy of
<application>apcupsd</application> there are a number important steps
to complete. You must either remove or modify the file
<filename>$HOME/apcupsd/bin/apccontrol</filename>, so that it will not
shutdown Computer A when the battery of UPS 2 is low. One suggestion
is to copy <filename>examples/safe.apccontrol</filename> into
<filename>$HOME/apcupsd/bin/apccontrol</filename>. Alternatively, you
could edit the <filename>$HOME/apcupsd/bin/apccontrol</filename> and
delete all statements that attempt to shutdown the machine. Another
important step is to find a way to shutdown Computer B when UPS 2's
battery is low.  Probably the simplest way to do this is to edit
<filename>$HOME/apcupsd/bin/apcupsd.conf</filename> on Computer A so
that this second copy of <application>apcupsd</application> becomes a
network master. Then install a standard slave configuration on
Computer B. Please remember that if UPS 1's batteries are exhausted
before UPS 2's batteries, Computer B may not be properly shutdown. And
at the current time, there is no simple means to make the two copies
of <application>apcupsd</application> running on Computer A
communicate. Thus there are certain risks in such a
configuration. However, these configurations can be very useful for
powering electronic equipment and such.</para>

<para>If Computer B is vitally important, it would probably be better
to purchase a serial port card for it, or perhaps use a USB UPS. To
ensure that it is properly shutdown if Computer A goes down, you could
run a second copy of <application>apcupsd</application> on Computer B
as a slave connected to the main copy of
<application>apcupsd</application> on Computer A. Thus Computer B
would be running two slaves, one driven by the master controlling UPS
1 and the other by the master controlling UPS 2, and Computer B could
be shutdown by the first master that signaled it to do so.</para>

<sect1><title>SNMP Specific Information</title>

<para>The SNMP connection gives less information compared to a serial
smart cable. This is not a problem as the most useful information
is given, together with a number of secondary parameters that are
informative enough to run safely your UPS.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Known Problems</title>

<para>Currently (as of 3.10.0) the code to power off the UPS needs
special configuration. The killpower command for SNMP UPSes can not be
issued during shutdown as typically at some time during shutdown
operations the network stack is stopped. To overcome this problem it
is needed to modify the <filename>/etc/rc.d/apcupsd</filename> system
control script to tell <application>apcupsd</application> to issue the
power down command (killpower) to the UPS immediately before apcupsd
initiates the system shutdown. For this reason it is paramount to set
your UPS grace time to a value greater than 120 seconds to allow for
clean shutdown operations before the UPS removes the power from its
plugs. To enable correct shutdown operation during powerdown do the
following:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>Connect to your Web/SNMP card using your favorite web browser,
     go to the UPS configuration menu and change the &quot;Shutdown Delay&quot;
     parameter to 180 seconds or more, depending on how much time your
     system shutdown requires to umount all the filesystems.</para>

<para>With this setup your UPS operations should be safe.</para>
</sect1>
</chapter>
<chapter><title>Alternate Ways To Run The Network Information Server</title>

<para><application>apcupsd</application> maintains STATUS and EVENTS
data concerning the UPS and its operation. This information can be
obtained over the network using either
<application>apcnisd</application> or
<application>apcupsd</application>'s internal network information
server, which is essentially the same code as
<application>apcnisd</application> but compiled into
<application>apcupsd</application>. Clients on the network make a
connection to the information server and send requests for status or
events data, which the server then transmits to them.</para>

<para>The information served to the network by this interface should
not be confused with master/slave mode that shares a UPS between two
or more computers. That code is described in <xref
linkend="UPS_Sharing"/> of this documentation.</para>

<para>There are three different ways to run the information server
depending on your requirements and preferences. It can be run as 1.  a
standalone program, 2. a standalone program invoked by the inetd
daemon, or 3. as a thread (or child process) of
<application>apcupsd</application> (default configuration). We
recommend option 3 unless you have specific reasons to do
otherwise. Option 3 is what is configured in by default.</para>

<sect1><title>Running the server as a child of <application>apcupsd</application></title>

<para>This is probably the simplest way to run the network information
server. To do so, you simply make sure the <emphasis
role="bold">NETSERVER</emphasis> directive in
<filename>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</filename> is <emphasis
role="bold">on</emphasis>, and then stop and restart
<application>apcupsd.</application> It will automatically create the
server thread (or spawn an additional child process named
<application>apcnis</application>) to handle network clients. In the
case where pthreads are enabled, a new thread will be created rather
than a child process to handle the network information requests. Note,
the above modification should not be necessary if you use the default
<filename>apcupsd.conf</filename>, since it is already turned
on.</para>

<para>Although this method is simple, it affords no protection from
the outside world accessing your network server unless you
are behind a firewall. In addition, if there is a bug in the network
server code, or if a malicious user sends bad data, it may be possible
for <application>apcnis</application> to die, in which case, though it
is not supposed to, <application>apcupsd</application> may also exit,
thus leaving your machine without shutdown protection. In addition,
since <application>apcupsd</application> is running at root level, all
threads or any child process will do so also. That being said, most of
us prefer to run the server this way.</para>

<para>With <application>apcupsd</application> version 3.8.2 and later,
you may enable the TCP Libwrap subroutines to add additional
security. In this case, access to the network server will be
controlled by the statements you put in
<filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title id="ApcnisdINETD">Running apcnisd from INETD</title>

<para>This is probably the most secure and most desirable way of
running the network information server. Unfortunately, it is a bit
more complicated to set up. However, once running, the server remains
unexecuted until a connection is attempted, at which point, inetd will
invoke <application>apcnisd</application>. Once
<application>apcnisd</application> has responded to the client's
requests, it will exit. None of the disadvantages of running it
standalone apply since <application>apcnisd</application> runs only
when a client is requesting data. Note, running in this manner works
only if you are using the old forking code and have pthreads
explicitly turned off. The pthreads version of
<application>apcupsd</application> does not support the shared memory
calls that are necessary for <application>apcnisd</application> to
access the internal state of
<application>apcupsd</application>.</para>

<para>An additional advantage of this method of running the network
information server is that you can call it with a TCP wrapper and thus
use access control lists (ACL) such as
<filename>hosts.allow</filename>. See the man pages for
<filename>hosts.allow</filename> for more details.</para>

<para>To configure <application>apcnisd</application> to run from
INETD, you must first put an entry in
<filename>/etc/services</filename> as follows:</para>

<programlisting>
apcnisd         3551/tcp
</programlisting>

<para>This defines the port number (3551) and the service (TCP) that
<application>apcnisd</application> will be using. This statement can
go anywhere in the services file. Normally, one adds local changes
such as these to the end of the file.</para>

<para>Next, you must modify <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename> to have the
following line:</para>

<programlisting>
apcnisd stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /sbin/apcnisd -i
</programlisting>

<para>If you do not want to run the TCP wrapper, then the line should
be entered as follows (not tested):</para>

<programlisting>
apcnisd stream  tcp     nowait  root    /sbin/apcnisd -i
</programlisting>

<para>Please check that the file locations are correct for your
system. Also, note that the <option>-i</option> option is necessary so
that <application>apcnisd</application> knows that it was called by
INETD. Before restarting INETD, first ensure that the <emphasis
role="bold">NETSERVER</emphasis> directive in
<filename>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</filename> is set to <emphasis
role="bold">off</emphasis>. This is necessary to prevent
<application>apcupsd</application> from starting a child process that
acts as a server. If you change <emphasis
role="bold">NETSERVER</emphasis>, you must stop and restart
<application>apcupsd</application> for the configuration change to be
effective.</para>

<para>Finally, you must restart INETD for it to listen on port 3551.
On a Red Hat system, you can do so by:</para>

<programlisting>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/inet reload
</programlisting>

<para>At this point, when a client attempts to make a connection on
port 3551, INETD will automatically invoke
<application>apcnisd</application>.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Running <application>apcnisd</application> Standalome</title>

<para>This is probably the least desirable of the three ways to run an
<application>apcupsd</application> network information server because
if <application>apcupsd</application> is stopped, you must also stop
<application>apcnisd</application> before you can restart
<application>apcupsd</application>. This is because
<application>apcnisd</application>, when run standalone, holds the
shared memory buffer by which <application>apcnisd</application> and
<application>apcupsd</application> communicate. This prevents a new
execution of <application>apcupsd</application> from creating
it.</para>

<para>To execute <application>apcnisd</application> in standalone
mode, first ensure that the <emphasis role="bold">NETSERVER</emphasis>
directive in <emphasis
role="bold">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</emphasis> is set to <emphasis
role="bold">off</emphasis>. This is necessary to prevent
<application>apcupsd</application> from starting a child process that
acts as a server. Restart <application>apcupsd</application> normally,
then:</para>

<programlisting>
/sbin/apcnisd
</programlisting>

<para>The advantage of running the network information server
standalone is that if for some reason, a client causes the network
server to crash, it will not affect the operation of
<application>apcupsd</application>.</para>

</chapter>
<chapter><title><application>apcupsd</application> System Logging</title>

<para>The <application>apcupsd</application> philosophy is that all
logging should be done through the <emphasis
role="bold">syslog</emphasis> facility (see: <command>man
syslog</command>). This is now implemented with the exceptions that
<emphasis role="bold">STATUS</emphasis> logging, for compatibility,
with prior versions is still done to a file, and <emphasis
role="bold">EVENTS</emphasis> logging can be directed to a
&quot;temporary&quot; file so that it can be reported by the network
information server.</para>

<sect1><title>Logging Types</title>

<para><application>apcupsd</application> splits its logging into four
separate types called:</para>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>DEBUG</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>DATA</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>STATUS</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>EVENTS</para>
  </listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Debug logging consists of debug messages. Normally these are
turned on only by developers, and currently there exist very few of
these debug messages.</para>

<bridgehead>DATA Logging</bridgehead>

<para>Data logging consists of periodically logging important data
concerning the operation of the UPS. See the <link
linkend='datalogging'>Data Logging</link> section of this manual for
more details.</para>

<bridgehead>STATUS Logging</bridgehead>

<para>Status logging consists of logging all available information known
about your UPS as a series of ASCII records. This information is
also made available by the <application>apcupsd</application> network
information server.</para>

<para>For more details on STATUS logging, see the <link
linkend="statusformat">Status</link> section of the Technical
Reference.</para>

<bridgehead>EVENTS Logging</bridgehead>

<para>Events logging consists of logging events as they happen. For
example, successful startup, power fail, battery failure, system
shutdown, ...</para>

<para>See the manual section on <link linkend='events'>customizing event
handling</link> for more details.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Implementation Details</title>

<para>In order to ensure that the data logged to syslog() can be directed
to different files, I have assigned syslog() levels to each of our
four types of data as follows:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>1. DEBUG logging has level LOG_DEBUG</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>2. DATA logging has level LOG_INFO</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>3. STATUS logging has level LOG_NOTICE</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>4. EVENTS logging has levels LOG_WARNING, LOG_ERR, 
LOG_CRIT, and LOG_ALERT</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>It should be noted that more work needs to be done on the
precise definitions of each of the levels for EVENTS logging.
Currently, it is roughly broken down as follows:</para>

<para>LOG_WARNING general information such as startup, etc.</para>

<para>LOG_ERR an error condition detected, e.g. communications problem
with the UPS.</para>

<para>LOG_CRIT a serious problem has occurred such as power failure,
running on UPS batteries, ...</para>

<para>LOG_ALERT a condition that needs immediate attention such as
pending system shutdown, ...</para>

<para>The default Facility for syslog() logging is DAEMON, although this
can be changed with the FACILITY directive in apcupsd.conf. In the
following example, we should the facility as local0.</para>

<para>More work needs to be done to the code to ensure that it
corresponds to the above levels.</para>

<para>As a practical example of how to setup your syslog() to use the
new logging feature, suppose you wish to direct all DATA logging to a
file named <filename>/var/log/apcupsd.data</filename>, all EVENTS to
the standard <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> file (to be mixed
with other system messages), and at the same time send all EVENTS to
<filename>/var/log/apcupsd.events</filename>, and finally, you want to
send all STATUS logging to the named pipe
<filename>/var/log/apcupsd.status</filename></para>

<para>First as root, you create the named pipe:</para>

<programlisting>
mkfifo /var/log/apcupsd.status
</programlisting>

<para>Change its permissions as necessary or use the -m option to set
them when creating the pipe.</para>

<para>Then you modify your <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> file
to direct the appropriate levels of messages where you want them. To
accomplish the above, my syslog.conf file looks like:</para>

<programlisting>
# exclude all apcupsd info by default
*.info;local0.none                    /var/log/messages

# Everything for apcupsd goes here
local0.info;local0.!notice             /var/log/apcupsd.data
local0.notice;local0.!warn            |/var/log/apcupsd.status
local0.warn                            /var/log/apcupsd.events
local0.warn                            /var/log/messages
</programlisting>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Developer's Notes</title>

<para>All logging functions and all error reporting are now done
through the log_event() subroutine call. Exceptions to this are:
initialization code where printf's are done, and writing to the
status file. Once the initialization code has completed and the
fork() to become a daemon is done, no printf's are used.
log_event() has exactly the same format as syslog(). In fact, the
subroutine consists of only a syslog() call. If anyone really
wishes to log to a file, the code to do so can easily be done by
adding code to log_event() in apclog.c.</para>

<part id='win32'><title>Legacy Installation: Windows</title>

<chapter><title>The Windows Version of <application>apcupsd</application></title>

<para>The Windows version of <application>apcupsd</application> has
been tested on Win95, Win98, WinMe, WinNT, WinXP, and Win2000
systems. This version of <application>apcupsd</application> has been
built to run under the CYGWIN environment, which provides many of the
features of Unix on Windows systems. It also permitted a rapid port
with very few source code changes, which means that the Windows
version is for the most part running code that has long proved stable
on Unix systems. Even though the Win32 version of
<application>apcupsd</application> is a port that relies on many Unix
features, it is just the same a true Windows program. When running, it
is perfectly integrated with Windows and displays its icon in the
system icon tray, and provides a system tray menu to obtain additional
information on how <application>apcupsd</application> is running
(status and events dialogue boxes). If so desired, it can also be
stopped by using the system tray menu, though this should normally
never be necessary.</para>

<para>Once installed <application>apcupsd</application> normally runs
as a system service.  This means that it is immediately started by the
operating system when the system is booted, and runs in the background
even if there is no user logged into the system.</para>

<sect1><title>Installation</title>

<para>Normally, you will install the Windows version of

<para>If you wish to install the package elsewhere, please note that you

particularly easy as you must rebuild the source and change the
configuration file as well.</para>

<para>This installation assumes that you do <emphasis
role="bold">not</emphasis> have CYGWIN installed on your computer. If
you do, and you use mount points, you may need to do a special manual
installation.</para>

<para>Once you have unzipped the binaries, open a window pointing to
the binary installation folder (normally
<filename>c:\apcupsd</filename>). This folder should contain folders
with the name bin, etc, examples, and manual. If and when you no
longer need them, the examples and manual sub-folders of the
<filename>c:\apcupsd</filename> directory may be removed.</para>

<para>Continuing the installation process:</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>Open the directory <filename>c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd</filename>
    in the Windows Explorer by Clicking on the apcupsd folder then on the

    double click on the file <filename>apcupsd.conf</filename> and edit it
    to contain the values appropriate for your site. In most cases, no
    changes will be needed, but if you are not using COM1 for your serial
    port, you will need to set the <emphasis role="bold">DEVICE</emphasis>
    configuration directive to the correct serial port. Note, if you are
    using WinNT or Win2000, the operating system may probe the port
    attempting to attach a serial mouse. This will cause
    <application>apcupsd</application> to be unable to communicate with
    the serial port. If this happens, or out of precaution, you can edit
    the <filename>c:\boot.ini</filename> file. Find the line that looks

<para>You probably should also click on the <emphasis

are not set correctly by default, please change them otherwise
<application>apcupsd</application> will not work.</para>

<para>For WinXP systems (and probably Win2K), the dialogs are a bit
different from those shown here for WinNT, but he concept is the
same. You get to the Services dialog by clicking on: <emphasis

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Installation Directory</title>

<para>The Win32 version of <application>apcupsd</application> must
reside in the <filename>c:\apcupsd\</filename> directory, and there
must be a <filename>c:\tmp</filename> directory on your machine. The
installation will do this automatically, and we recommend that you do
not attempt to place <application>apcupsd</application> in another
directory. If you do so, you are on your own, and you will need to do
a rebuild of the source.</para> </sect1>
<sect1><title>Testing</title>

<para>It would be hard to overemphasize the need to do a full testing
of your installation of <application>apcupsd</application> as there
are a number of reasons why it may not behave properly in a real power
failure situation.</para>

<para>Please read <xref linkend="testing"/> of
this document for general instructions on testing the Win32
version. However, on Win32 systems, there is no Unix system log
file, so if something goes wrong, look in the file
<filename>c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apcupsd.events</filename> where apcupsd
normally logs its events, and you will generally find more detailed
information on why the program is not working. The most common
cause of problems is either improper configuration of the cable
type, or an incorrect address for the serial port.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Upgrading</title>

<para>On Win98 and Win95 systems, to upgrade to a new release, simply
stop <application>apcupsd</application> by using the tray icon and
selecting the <emphasis role="bold">Close
<application>apcupsd</application></emphasis> menu item, or by double
clicking on the <emphasis role="bold">Stop</emphasis> icon located in
the <filename>c:\apcupsd\bin</filename> directory, then apply the
upgrade and restart <application>apcupsd</application>.</para>

<para>On WinNT systems (and Win2000 systems), you may stop
<application>apcupsd</application> as indicated abover or
alternatively you may stop <application>apcupsd</application> by using
the <emphasis role="bold">Services</emphasis> item in the <emphasis
role="bold">Control Panel</emphasis>. In addition, at least on my
system, there seems to be a WinNT bug that causes the system to
prevent <emphasis role="bold">apcupsd.exe</emphasis> from being
overwritten even though the file is no longer being used.  This is
manifested by an error message when attempting load a new version and
overwrite the old <application>apcupsd.exe</application> (the extract
part of WinZip as described above). To circumvent this problem (if it
happens to you), after shutting down the running version of
<application>apcupsd</application>, through the <emphasis
role="bold">Services</emphasis> dialogue in the <emphasis
role="bold">Control Panel</emphasis>, first click on the <emphasis
role="bold">Stop button</emphasis>:</para>

<mediaobject>
  <imageobject>
    <imagedata fileref="wininstall6.png" depth="339" width="672"/>
  </imageobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>then click on the <emphasis role="bold">Startup ...</emphasis>
button, and in the Startup dialogue select the <emphasis
role="bold">Disabled</emphasis> button to disable
<application>apcupsd</application>:</para>

<mediaobject>
  <imageobject>
    <imagedata fileref="wininstall7.png" depth="405" width="382"/>
  </imageobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>After closing the dialogues, reboot the system, typical of
Microsoft :-(. When the system comes back up,
<application>apcupsd</application> will not be automatically launched
as a service, and you can install the new version. To reinstate
<application>apcupsd</application> as an automatic service, using the
<emphasis role="bold">Control Panel</emphasis>: reset
<application>apcupsd</application> to <emphasis
role="bold">Automatic</emphasis> startup in the Startup dialogue, then
restart <application>apcupsd</application> in the <emphasis
role="bold">Services</emphasis> dialogue as shown above in the
installation instructions. Frequently after an upgrade, you will click
on the <emphasis role="bold">Start</emphasis> button and after a few
seconds, the system reports that it failed to start. The cause of this
problem is unknown, but the solution is simply to click again on the
<emphasis role="bold">Start</emphasis> button.</para> </sect1>
<sect1><title>Post
Installation</title>

<para>After installing <application>apcupsd</application> and before
running it, you should check the contents of two files to ensure that
it is configured properly for your system. The first is
<filename>c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apcupsd.conf</filename>. You will
probably need to change your UPSCABLE directive, your UPSTYPE and
possibly your DEVICE directives. Please refer to the configuration
section of this manual for more details.</para>

<para>The second file that you should examine is
<filename>c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apccontrol</filename>. This file is
called by <application>apcupsd</application> when events (power loss,
etc) are generated. It permits the user to program handling the
event. In particular, it permits the user to be notified of the
events. For the Win32 version, each event is programmed to display a
Windows popup dialogue box. If your machine is mostly unattended, you
may want to comment out some of these popup dialogue boxes by putting
a pound sign (#) in column one of the appropriate line.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Problem Areas</title>

<para>In addition to possible problems of reinstallation or upgrade on
WinNT systems, as noted above, we have discovered the following
problem: On some Windows systems, the domain resolution does not seem
to work if you have not configured a DNS server in the Network section
of the Control Panel. This problem should be apparent only when
running a master or a slave configuration. In this case, when you
specify the name of the master or the slave machine(s) in your
<filename>apcupsd.conf</filename> file, apcupsd will be unable to
resolve the name to a valid IP address. To circumvent this problem,
simply enter all machine addresses as an IP address rather than a
domain name, or alternatively, ensure that you have a valid DNS server
configured on your system (often not the case on Win32 systems).  For
example, instead of using the directive &quot;MASTER
my.master.com&quot; use something like &quot;MASTER 192.168.1.54&quot;
where you replace the IP address with your actual IP address.</para>

<para>Also, on WinNT systems, the PIF files in
<filename>/apcupsd/bin</filename> used for starting and stopping
<application>apcupsd</application> do not work. Use the services
control panel instead.</para>

<para>On Win95 systems, there are reports that the PIF files do not
work. If you find that to be the case, the simplest solution is to use
the batch files that we have supplied in the
<filename>c:/apcupsd/bin</filename> directory. Also, on Win95 systems,
we have an unconfirmed report that indicates that
<application>apcupsd</application> does not start automatically as a
service even though the Registry has been properly updated. If you
experience this problem, a work around is to put a shortcut to
<application>apcupsd</application> in the StartUp folder.</para>

<para>As noted above, after an upgrade, you may need to start
<application>apcupsd</application> several times before it will
actually run.</para>

<para>On WinNT, WinXP, and Win2K systems, you can examine the System
Applications log to which <application>apcupsd</application> writes
Windows error messages during startup.</para>

<para>Regardless of which Windows system you are running,
<application>apcupsd</application> logs most error messages to
<filename>c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apcupsd.events</filename>. This type
error messages such as configuration file not found, etc are written
to this file.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Utility Functions</title>

<para>The directory <filename>c:\apcupsd\bin</filename> contains six
utility routines (actually .pif files) that you may find useful. They
are:</para>

<programlisting>
Start
Stop
Install
Uninstall
ups-events
ups-status
</programlisting>

<para>Any of these utilities may be used on any system, with the
exception of the Start utility, which cannot be used on WinNT and
Win2000 systems. On those systems, the apcupsd service must always be
started through the <emphasis role="bold">Services</emphasis>
sub-dialogue of the <emphasis role="bold">Control
Panel</emphasis>.</para>

<para>The <emphasis role="bold">Install</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="bold">Uninstall</emphasis> utilities install and uninstall
apcupsd from the system registry only. All other pieces (files) of
apcupsd remain intact. It is not absolutely necessary for apcupsd to
be installed in the registry as it can run as a regular
program. However, if it is not installed in the registry, it cannot be
run as a service.</para>

<para>The functions of <emphasis role="bold">Stop</emphasis>,
<emphasis role="bold">ups-events</emphasis>, and <emphasis
role="bold">ups-status</emphasis> can be more easily invoked by right
clicking on the apcupsd icon in the system tray and selecting the
desired function from the popup menu.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Disclaimer</title>

<para>Some of the features such as EEPROM programming have not been
exhaustively tested on Win32 systems. If at all possible, we
recommend not to use it as a network master on Win95, Win98, and
WinMe due to the instability of those operating systems.</para>

<para>Some items to note:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>    
    <para>This version of apcupsd will not attempt to shut off the
    UPS power when the battery is exhausted. Thus if the power returns
    before the UPS completely shuts down, your computer may not reboot
    automatically. This is because we do not know how to regain control
    after the disks have been synced in order to shut off the UPS
    power.</para>

    <para>Nevertheless, it is possible to use the
    <option>--kill-on-powerfail</option> option on the apcupsd command
    line, but the use of this option could cause the power to be cut
    off while your machine is still running. See <xref
    linkend="shutdown"/> of this document for a more complete
    discussion of this subject. If you are still interested in trying
    to get this to work, please look at the code that is commented out
    in <filename>c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apccontrol</filename> under
    the <emphasis role="bold">doshutdown</emphasis> case.</para>

    <para>An alternative to the <option>--kill-on-powerfail</option>
    option is to use the <link linkend="KILLDELAY">KILLDELAY</link>
    configuration directive.</para>

    <para>This configuration directive is appropriate on Windows machines
    where apcupsd continues to run even when the machine is
    halted (as is the case on most NT machines).</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>When apcupsd detects important events, it calls
    <filename>c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apccontrol</filename>, which is a
    Unix shell script. You may modify this script to suit your
    particular needs.  Currently, it puts a Windows dialogue on the
    screen with a brief explanation of the event. If these dialogues
    annoy you, you can remove or comment out the calls to <emphasis
    role="bold">popup</emphasis> from this file.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Email Notification of Events</title>

<para>On Win95/98 systems, it is possible to receive notification of
apcupsd events that are passed to
<application>apccontrol</application>. This is possible using a simple
email program that unfortunately is not functioning 100% correctly. In
addition, I (Kern) was not able to make this program work on WinNT
while apcupsd is running as a service under the system account (it
works fine with any user account).</para>

<para>If you wish to try this program on Win95/98 systems, look at the
files named <emphasis role="bold">changeme, commfailure, commok,
onbattery, and mainsback</emphasis> in the directory
<filename>c:\apcupsd\examples</filename>. To use them, you must modify
the SYSADMIN variable to have a valid email address, then copy the
files into the directory
<filename>c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd</filename>.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Killpower under Windows</title>

<para>If your batteries become exhausted during a power failure and
you want your machine to automatically reboot when the power comes
back, it is useful to implement the
<application>killpower</application> feature of the UPS where apcupsd
sends the UPS the command to shut off the power.  In doing so, the
power will be cut to your PC and if your BIOS is properly setup, the
machine will automatically reboot when the power comes back. This is
important for servers.</para>

<para>This feature is implemented on Unix systems by first requesting
a system shutdown. As a part of the shutdown, apcupsd is terminated
by the system, but the shutdown process executes a script where
apcupsd is recalled after the disks are synced and the machine is
idle. Bacula then requests the UPS to shut off the power
(killpower).</para>

<para>Unfortunately on Windows, there is no such shutdown script that
we are aware of and no way for apcupsd to get control after the
machine is idled. If this feature is important to you, it is
possible to do it by telling apcupsd to immediately issue the
killpower command after issuing the shutdown request. The danger in
doing so is that if the machine is not sufficiently idled when the
killpower takes place, the disks will need to be rescanned (and
there is a possibility of lost data however small). Generally,
UPSes have a shutdown grace period which gives sufficient time for
the OS to shutdown before the power is cut.</para>

<para>To implement this feature, you need to add the
<option>-p</option> option to the apcupsd command line that is
executed by the system.  Currently the procedure is manual. You do so
by editing the registry and changing the line:</para>

<programlisting>
c:\apcupsd\apcupsd.exe /service
</programlisting>

<para>found under the key:</para>

<programlisting>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
</programlisting>

<para>to</para>

<programlisting>
c:\apcupsd\apcupsd.exe /service -p
</programlisting>

<para>If you have a Smart UPS, you can configure the kill power grace
period, and you might want to set it to 3 minutes. If you have a
dumb UPS, there is no grace period and you should not use this
procedure. If you have a Back-UPS CS or ES, these UPSes generally
have a fixed grace period of 2 minutes, which is probably
sufficient.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Power Down During Shutdown</title>

<para>Our philosophy is to shutdown a computer but not to power it down
itself (as opposed to having the UPS cut the power as described
above). That is we prefer to idle a computer but leave it running.
This has the advantage that in a power fail situation, if the
killpower function described above does not work, the computer will
continue to draw down the batteries and the UPS will hopefully
shutoff before the power is restore thus permitting an automatic
reboot. </para>

<para>Nevertheless some people prefer to do a full power down. To do
so, you might want to get a copy of PsShutdown, which does have a
power down option. You can find it and a lot more useful software at:
<ulink
url="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pstools.shtml">http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pstools.shtml</ulink>.
to use their shutdown program rather than the apcupsd supplied
version, you simply edit:</para>

<programlisting>
c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apccontrol
</programlisting>

<para>with any text editor and change our calls to shutdown to
psshutdown.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>Command Line Options Specific to the Windows Version</title>

<para>These options are not normally seen or used by the user, and are
documented here only for information purposes. At the current time,
to change the default options, you must either manually run
apcupsd or you must manually edit the system registry and
modify the appropriate entries.</para>

<para>In order to avoid option clashes between the options necessary
for apcupsd to run on Windows and the standard
apcupsd options, all Windows specific options are signaled
with a forward slash character (/), while as usual, the standard
apcupsd options are signaled with a minus (-), or a minus
minus (--). All the standard apcupsd options can be used on
the Windows version. In addition, the following Windows only
options are implemented:</para>

<chapter><title>Overview of Serial-Interface UPSes</title>

<para>If you have a UPS that communicates via serial port, you need to
do two things before you can even think about configuring the
software. First, you need to figure out whether it's a dumb
(voltage-signalling) UPS or speaks the apcsmart protocol (see <link
linkend='upstypes'>this discussion</link>).  Second, if you have an
interface cable from APC, you need to figure out what kind it is.  If
you don't have such a cable, you need to build one.  A
straight-through serial cable <link linkend='crazy'>won't
work</link>.</para>

</chapter>
<chapter><title>Connecting a Serial-Line UPS to a USB Port</title>

<para>By using a special adaptor, you can connect your serial-line UPS
to a USB port. If you would like to free up your serial port and
connect your existing serial port UPS to a USB port, it is possible if
you have one of the later kernels. You simply get a serial to USB
adapter that is supported by the kernel, plug it in and make one minor
change to your <filename>apcupsd.conf</filename> file and away you
go. (Kern adds: Thanks to Joe Acosta for this out to
me.)</para>

<para>The device that Joe Acosta and Kern are using is IOgear guc232a USB 2
serial adapter. There may be other adapters that work equally well.
If you know of one, please let us know.</para>

<para>At Kern's site, running Red Hat 7.1 with kernel 2.4.9-12, he
simply changed his <filename>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</filename>
configuration line to be:</para>

<programlisting>
DEVICE /dev/ttyUSB0
</programlisting>

<para>Depending on whether or not you have <emphasis
role="bold">hotplug</emphasis> working, you may need to explicitly
load the kernel modules <emphasis role="bold">usbserial</emphasis> and
<emphasis role="bold">pl2303</emphasis>. In Kern's case, this was not
necessary.</para>

<para>In fact, it turns out the protocol adaptor isn't necessary if
you have the right cable.  The ports on APC USB UPSes not only speak
USB, but also serial apcsmart and dumb voltage-signalling as well!
This is something that one of our users discovered by accident. With the
Custom RJ45 cable described below plugged into the APC UPS USB socket at
one end and the other end plugged into a serial port on your PC, any
APPC USB UPS will act as a serial-line device.</para>

</chapter>

<chapter id='cables'><title>Cables</title>

<para>You can either use the cable that came with your UPS
(the easiest if we support it) or you can make your own cable. We
recommend that you obtain a supported cable directly from APC.</para>
<para>If you already have an APC cable, you can determine what kind it
is by examining the flat sides of the two connectors where you will
find the cable number embossed into the plastic. It is generally on
one side of the male connector.</para>

<para>To make your own cable you must first know whether you have a
UPS that speaks the apcsmart protocol or a &quot;dumb&quot; UPS that
uses serial port line voltage signalling.</para>

<para>If you have an apcmart UPS, and you build your
own cable, build a <emphasis>Smart-Custom</emphasis> cable. If you
have a voltage-Signalling or dumb UPS, build a

<sect1><title>Smart Signalling Cable for BackUPS CS Models</title>

<para>If you have a BackUPS CS, you are probably either using it with
the USB cable that is supplied or with the 940-0128A supplied by APC,
which permits running the UPS in dumb mode. By building your own
cable, you can now run the BackUPS CS models (and perhaps also the ES
models) using smart signalling and have all the same information that
is available as running it in USB mode.</para>

<para>The jack in the UPS is actually a 10 pin RJ45. However, you can
just as easily use a 8 pin RJ45 connector, which is more standard
(ethernet TX, and ISDN connector). It is easy to construct the cable
by cutting off one end of a standard RJ45-8 ethernet cable and wiring
the other end (three wires) into a standard DB9F female serial port
connector.</para>

<para>Below, you will find a diagram for the CUSTOM-RJ45 cable:</para>

<para>We use the DTR (pin 4 on the female connector) as our +5 volts
power for the circuit. It is used as the Vcc pull-up voltage for
testing the outputs on any &quot;UPS by APC&quot; in voltage-signalling
mode.  This cable may not work on a BackUPS Pro if the default
communications are in apcsmart mode. This cable is also valid for
&quot;ShareUPS&quot; BASIC Port mode and is also reported to work on
SmartUPSes. However, the Smart Cable described above is much
simpler. To have a better idea of what is going on inside
<application>apcupsd</application>, for the SIMPLE cable
<application>apcupsd</application> reads three signals and sets
three:</para>

<literallayout>
Reads:
CD, which apcupsd uses for the On Battery signal when high.

CTS, which apcupsd uses for the Battery Low signal when high.

RxD (SR), which apcupsd uses for the Line Down 
    signal when high. This signal isn't used for much.

Sets:
DTR, which apcupsd sets when it detects a power failure (generally
     5 to 10 seconds after the CD signal goes high). It
     clears this signal if the CD signal subsequently goes low
     -- i.e. power is restored.

TxD (ST), which apcupsd clears when it detects that the CD signal
     has gone low after having gone high - i.e. power is restored.

RTS, which apcupsd sets for the killpower signal -- to cause the UPS
     to shut off the power.
</literallayout>

<para>Please note that these actions apply only to the SIMPLE cable,
the signals used on the other cables are different.</para>
<para>Finally, here is another way of looking at the CUSTOM-SIMPLE
cable:</para>

<sect1><title>Voltage Signalling</title>

<para>Apparently, all APC voltage-signalling UPSes have the same
signals on the output pins of the UPS. The difference at the computer
end is due to different cable configurations. Thus, by measuring the
connectivity of a cable, one can determine how to program the UPS.
This is to be verified.</para>

<para>The signals presented or accepted by the UPS on its DB9
connector using the numbering scheme listed above is:</para>

<literallayout>
UPS Pin         Signal meaning
 1     &lt;-     Shutdown when set by computer for 1-5 seconds.
 2     -&gt;     On battery power (this signal is normally low but
                    goes high when the UPS switches to batteries).
 3     -&gt;     Mains down (line fail) See Note 1 below.
 5     -&gt;     Low battery. See Note 1 below.
 6     -&gt;     Inverse of mains down signal. See Note 2 below.
 7     &lt;-     Turn on/off power (only on advanced UPSes only)

 Note 1: these two lines are normally open, but close when the
     appropriate signal is triggered. In fact, they are open collector
     outputs which are rated for a maximum of +40VDC and 25 mA. Thus
     the 4.7K ohm resistor used in the Custom Simple cable works 
     quite well.

 Note 2: the same as note 1 except that the line is normally closed,
     and opens when the line voltage fails.

used as a loopback input to determine if the cable is plugged in.

* DCD is the &quot;battery low&quot; signal to the computer.  A SPACE on this
line means the battery is low.  This is signalled by BATTERY-LOW
being pulled down (it is probably open circuit normally).

Normally, the transistor is turned off, and DCD is held at the MARK
voltage by TxD.  When BATTERY-LOW is pulled down, the voltage
divider R2/R1 biases the transistor so that it is turned on, causing
DCD to be pulled up to the SPACE voltage.

* TxD must be held at MARK; this is the default state when no data is
being transmitted.  This sets the default bias for both DCD and
SHUTDOWN.  If this line is an open circuit, then when BATTERY-LOW is
signalled, SHUTDOWN will be automatically signalled; this would be
true if the cable were plugged in to the UPS and not the computer,
or if the computer were turned off.

* RTS is the &quot;shutdown&quot; signal from the computer.  A SPACE on this
line tells the UPS to shut down.

* RxD and RI are both the &quot;power-fail&quot; signals to the computer.  A
MARK on this line means the power has failed.

* SPACE is a positive voltage, typically +12V.  MARK is a negative
voltage, typically -12V.  Linux appears to translate SPACE to a 1
and MARK to a 0.

<sect2><title>BackUPS ES and CS in Serial mode with Cable 940-0128A</title>

<para>Though these UPSes are USB UPSes, APC supplies a serial cable
(typically with a green DB9 F connector) that has 940-0128A stamped
into one side of the plastic serial port connector. The other end of
the cable is a 10 pin RJ45 connector that plugs into the UPS (thanks
to Dean Waldow for sending me a cable!). Apcupsd version 3.8.5 and
later supports this cable when specified as <emphasis
role="bold">UPSCABLE 940-0128A</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="bold">UPSTYPE backups</emphasis>. However, running in this mode
much of the information that would be available in USB mode is
lost. In addition, when <application>apcupsd</application> attempts to
instruct the UPS to kill the power, it begins cycling about 4 times a
second between battery and line. The solution to the problem (thanks
to Tom Suzda) is to unplug the UPS and while it is still chattering,
press the power button (on the front of the unit) until the unit beeps
and the chattering stops. After that the UPS should behave normally
and power down 1-2 minutes after requested to do so.</para>

<para>An amazing discovery by slither_man allows one to build a
CUSTOM-RJ45 cable (documented above) and run the BackUPS CS (and
probably also the ES) in Smart mode. Running it this way provides
all the same information that you would get by running it in USB
mode. As a consequence, we recommend that you either purchase
(where I don't know) or build your own CUSTOM-RJ45 cable rather
than use the 940-0128A cable.</para>

<para>Thanks to all the people who have helped test this and have
provided information on the cable wiring, our best guess for the
cable schematic is the following:</para>

UPS is responding to commands.  This can be a bit tricky, especially
with a dumb voltage-signalling interface, because it is completely
quiescent when there are no commands being passed, and the command 
repertoire doesn't include any self-tests.</para>

<para>Because it is easy to configure a serial cable incorrectly in
such a way as to cause premature shutdowns of the UPS power, we
<emphasis>strongly</emphasis> recommend, especially for voltage-
signaling (dumb) UPSes, that you do most of the initial testing with
your computer plugged into the wall rather than your UPS. Thus if the
UPS power is suddenly shut off, your computer will continue to run. We
also recommend using <application>safe-apccontrol</application> as
described below, until you are sure that the signaling is
correct.</para>

<para>Also note that if you launch the execution of
<application>apcupsd</application> while your voltage-signaling UPS is
on battery power, it is very likely that your UPS will immediately
shut off the power. This is due to the initialization of the serial
port line signals, which often looks to the UPS like a shutdown
command.</para>

<para>Finally, double-check the state of your cabling and UPS
indicator lights frequently during testing.  For voltage-signaling
UPSes, <application>apcupsd</application> is not currently able to
detect whether or not the serial cable is connected. In addition, some
simple signaling UPSes with certain cable combinations are not able to
detect the low battery condition.  For more details please see
<xref linkend="CableModes"/>.</para>

the settings 2400 8N1 (2400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit). Be
extremely careful what you send to your UPS as certain characters may
cause it to power down or may even cause damage to the UPS. Try
sending an upper case Y to the UPS (without a return at the end). It

<sect1><title>Determining Which Voltage-Signaling Cable You Have</title>

<para><emphasis>The most frequently encountered problem with
voltage-signalling UPSes (e.g. BackUPS 650) is that you have
incorrectly specified which cable is being used.</emphasis> All cables
furnished by APC have the cable number stamped on the side of the
computer connector end of the cable. Using this number with
<application>apcupsd</application> will normally work fine. If you do
not know what cable you have, you can use the
<application>apctest</application> program to determine the type of
the cable.</para>

<para>For simple signaling UPSes, you should <emphasis>not</emphasis>
use <emphasis role="bold">simple</emphasis> in the cable specification
(i.e. <emphasis role="bold">UPSCABLE simple</emphasis>) unless you
have made the cable yourself according to the wiring diagram given in
the cables chapter of this manual.</para>

<para>One additional note applies:</para>

<sect2><title>Bizarre Intermittent Behavior</title>

<para>In one case, a user reported that he received random incorrect
values from the UPS in the status output. It turned out that
<application>gpm</application>, the mouse control program for command
windows, was using the serial port without using the standard Unix
locking mechanism. As a consequence, both
<application>apcupsd</application> and <application>gpm</application>
were reading the serial port. Please ensure that if you are running
<application>gpm</application> that it is not configured with a serial
port mouse on the same serial port.</para>

<chapter><title>Recalibrating the UPS Runtime</title>

<para>Note: In a future release of <application>apcupsd</application>
this procedure will be replaced by a daemon operation that can be
performed on all types of UPS.</para>

<para>This section does not apply to voltage-signalling or dumb UPSes
such as the older BackUPS models.</para>

<para>Smart UPSes internally compute the remaining runtime, and
<application>apcupsd</application> uses the value supplied by the
UPS. As the batteries age (after say two or three years), the runtime
computation may no longer be accurate since the batteries no longer
hold the same charge. As a consequence, in the event of a power
failure, the UPS and thus <application>apcupsd</application> can
report a runtime of 5 minutes remaining when in fact only one minute
remains. This can lead to a shutdown before you might expect it,
because regardless of the runtime remaining that is reported, the UPS
will always correctly detect low batteries and report it, thus causing
<application>apcupsd</application> to correctly shutdown your
computer.</para>

<para>If you wish to have the UPS recalibrate the remaining runtime
calculations, you can do so manually as the current version of
<application>apcupsd</application> does not support this feature. To
do so,</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>Shutdown <application>apcupsd</application></para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>contact your UPS directly using some terminal program such as
    <application>minicom</application>, <application>tip</application>, or <application>cu</application> with the settings 2400 8N1 (2400 baud, 8 bits,
no parity, 1 stop bit). Be extremely careful what you send to your
UPS as certain characters may cause it to power down or may even
cause damage to the UPS. Try sending an upper case Y to the UPS
(without a return at the end). It should respond with SM. If this
is not the case, read the chapter on testing. If you fat finger the
Y and enter y instead, no cause for alarm, you will simply get the
APC copyright notice.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>when you are sure you are properly connected send an upper case
D (no cr). This will put the UPS into calibration mode, and it will
drain the battery down to 25% capacity (35% for a Matrix) at which
point it will go back on the mains. In doing so, it will recompute
the runtime calibration.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>If you wish to abort the calibration, enter a second D command.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>When you are done, restart <application>apcupsd</application>.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>In principle, you should be able to do this with the computer
powered by the UPS, but if you wish to be completely safe, you should
plug your computer into the wall prior to performing the runtime
calibration. In that case, you will need to artificially load the UPS
with light bulbs or other means. You should supply a load of about 30
to 35% but not more than 50%. You can determine the load by looking at
the output of the <command>apcaccess status</command> command while
<application>apcupsd</application> is running.</para>

<para>You should not run the recalibration command more than once or
twice per year as discharging these kinds of batteries tends to
shorten their life span.</para>

<para>Any value that is not supported by your UPS such as
AmbientTemperature and Humidity will be blank or possibly as 0.0.
In any case the commas before and after that field will still be

    <listitem>
      <para>After a power failure, <application>apcupsd</application>

      of zero disables this timer. Normally for all Smart UPS models
      and dumb UPSes with cables that support low battery detection,

      by the battery level and/or remaining runtime (see above) or in
      the case of a voltage-signalling UPS, when the battery is
      exhausted. This command is required for dumb UPSes that do not
      provide a battery exhausted signal (only testing can determine
      this point). For more information, see the <link
      linkend='testing'>Testing</link> section of this manual. This
      timer can also be useful if you want some slave machines to
      shutdown before other machines to conserve battery power. It is
      also useful for testing <application>apcupsd</application>
      because you can force a rapid shutdown by setting a small value
      (e.g. 60) and pulling the plug to the UPS.</para>

      <para>When apcupsd is running in master mode (UPSCLASS
      netmaster), and a shutdown condition is determined,
      <application>apcupsd</application> will notify each of the
      slaves to perform a shutdown then apcupsd will sleep for 30
      seconds before issuing the shutdown of its own computer. If you
      need the master to wait additional time before shutting down (to
      allow for shutdown of slower slaves or of slaves running
      software that requires more time to shutdown &mdash; e.g. databases),
      you can do so by adding additional sleep() commands to
      <filename>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</filename> in each case that 
      causes a shutdown.</para>

      <para><emphasis role='bold'>TIMEOUT</emphasis>, <emphasis

      problems. apcupsd will react to the first case or test that is
      valid. Normally SmartUPS users will set <emphasis
      role='bold'>TIMEOUT</emphasis> to zero so that the system is
      shutdown depending on the percentage battery charge remaining
      (<emphasis role='bold'>BATTERYLEVEL</emphasis>) or the remaining

<para>In addition to the old master/slave code, there is now a new
network driver enabled with <option>--enable-net</option> (default
disabled) that can be used to control a slave from any version of
apcupsd running NIS. This is a much more flexible system of
controlling slaves because a slave machine that also has NIS turned on
can thus act as a master for another slave with

slave obtains the address of the master from the <emphasis

      <para>Used in master configuration files, this is the name of a slave
      machine that depends on this master. There can be a maximum of 20
      slaves attached to one master. Thus you can specify multiple SLAVE
      directives in a master configuration file. Only one slave name can
      be specified per SLAVE directive, thus for multiple slaves, specify
      multiple SLAVE directives.</para>

      <para>As noted above the master and slaves continue to communicate
      over the network even after the master has issued a shutdown
      command to the slaves. This is because the master 
      <application>apcupsd</application> continues to run until it receives

      <para>The USERMAGIC directive is a sort of password that gives a second

      character string up to 17 characters in length. It should be unique for 
      each slave. When the slave makes initial contact with the master, this 
      string is passed to the master. Then on each transmission from the 
      master to the slave, the string is passed back to the slave, which 
      checks that it is the correct string before accepting the master's 
      information. This string should be different for each and every slave 
      on the network. This directive is not required.</para>

<chapter id='statusformat'><title><application>apcupsd</application> Status Logging</title>

<para>There is a good deal of information available about the UPS and
<application>apcupsd</application>'s status. This document describes
the format of that information.  Normally you will get at it via
<application>apcaccess</application>, but there are other ways as
well.</para>

<sect1><title>Status report format</title>

<para>The STATUS output is in ASCII format with a single data value or
piece of information on each line output. Because not all UPSes supply
the same information, the output varies based on the type of UPS that
you are using. In general, if the information is not available for
your UPS, the data portion of the output record will contain an
<emphasis role="bold">N/A</emphasis> indicating that the information
is not available.</para>

<para>Status logging consists of periodically logging ALL available
information concerning the UPS. Since the volume of data is rather
large (over 1000 bytes per status), the STATUS data is not
automatically sent to the system log file, instead, it is written
as a series of data records to a specific file (normally
<filename>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.status</filename>).</para>

<para>After each write, the file is rewound so that the size of the
file remains constant. At the current time, this file is 1135
bytes. The format of this file is very similar to the old
<application>apcupsd</application> procfs file. The STATUS file is
kept for backward compatibility and will be eliminated in a future
version of <application>apcupsd</application>. The preferred method
for obtaining this information is from
<application>apcaccess</application> or by using the <link
linkend='cgiprogs'>CGI interface</link>.</para>

<para>To make reading the status data reliable via a named pipe, the
first record written contains a version number, the number of
records that follow the first record, and the total number of bytes
in those subsequent records. An actual example of such a status
file (/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.status) is:</para>

<para>Consequently, the first record always consists of 24 bytes (23
characters followed by a newline). This record starts with APC and
as indicated in the example above is followed by 28 records
consisting of 675 bytes. The last record begins with END APC and
contains the date and time matching the DATE record.</para>

<para>Documentation of each record needs to be written. In the coming
weeks, I plan to add additional records and possibly change the
names of some of the fields.</para>

<para>When this data is written to a file, it is written as two
records, the first record, and all the other records together. In
reading the file, it can be either be read a record at a time, or
in one big read.</para>

<para>When this data is written to syslog(), it is written a record at
a time. The first record is the first 24 bytes. By having the
number of records and the size in the first record, the complete
status can be reliably reassembled.</para>

<sect1><title>Logging the STATUS Information</title>

<para>If specified in the configuration file, the STATUS data will also
be written to the system log file. Please note, that it would not
normally be wise to write this data to a normal system log file as
there is no mechanism in syslog() to rewind the file and hence the
log file would quickly become enormous. However, in two cases, it
can be very useful to use syslog() to write this information.</para>

<para>The first case is to set up your
<filename>syslog.conf</filename> file so that the data is written to a
named pipe. In this case, normally not more than about 8192 bytes of
data will be kept before it is discarded by the system.</para>

<para>The second case is to setup your syslog.conf file so that the
status data is sent to another machine, which presumably then
writes it to a named pipe. Consequently, with this mechanism,
provides a simple means of networking apcupsd STATUS
information.</para>

<para>Although we mention system logging of STATUS information, we
strongly recommend that you use  <application>apcaccess</application>
or the CGI interface to get this information.</para>

<chapter><title>The Shutown Sequence and its Discontents</title>

<sect1 id='shutdown'><title>Shutdown Sequence</title>

<para>If you experienced so problems with the testing procedures, or
if you are porting <application>apcupsd</application> to another
system, or you are simply curious, you may want to know exactly what
is going on during the shutdown process.</para>

<para>The shutdown sequence is as follows:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para><application>apcupsd</application> detects that there is a
    power problem and it calls <command>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol
    powerout</command>, which normally sends a message to all users
    informing them of a potential problem.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>After approximately 5 seconds in the power problem mode,
    <application>apcupsd</application> calls
    <command>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol onbattery</command>, which
    normally sends a message to all users informing them that the UPS
    is on batteries.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
     <para>When one of the conditions listed below occurs,
     <application>apcupsd</application> issues a shutdown command by
     calling <command>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol doshutdown</command>,
     which should perform a shutdown of your system using the system
     <citerefentry><refentrytitle>shutdown</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
     command. You can modify the behavior by editing the
     <filename>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</filename> script, but doing so
     will make it more complicated to upgrade to the next
     <application>apcupsd</application> version.</para>

     <para>The conditions that trigger the shutdown can be: running time on
     batteries have expired (TIMEOUT), the battery runtime remaining is
     below the configured value (BATTERYLEVEL), the estimated remaining
     runtime is below the configured value (MINUTES), or the UPS signals
     that the batteries are exhausted.</para>

     <para>A shutdown could also be initiated if 
     <application>apcupsd</application> detects
     that the batteries are no longer functioning correctly. This case,
     though very unusual, can happen at any time even if there is proper
     mains voltage, and <command>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol emergency</command> is
     called.</para>

     <para>Just before initiating any shutdown through the 
     <application>apccontrol</application>
     script, <application>apcupsd</application> will create the file
     <filename>/etc/apcupsd/powerfail</filename>. This file will be
     used later in the shutdown sequence to recall 
     <application>apcupsd</application> after syncing of the
     disks to initiate a power off of the UPS.</para>

     <para>If the <filename>/etc/nologin</filename> file has not
     already been created, it will normally be created during the
     shutdown sequence to prevent additional users from logging in 
     (see the NOLOGIN configuration directive).</para>

     <para>Even though <application>apcupsd</application> has
     requested the system to perform a shutdown, it continues
     running. If it is a master with slaves, it will inform the slaves
     to do a shutdown. They perform their shutdown by calling
     <command>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol remotedown</command>.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>When the system signals <application>apcupsd</application>
    to do exit, it does so.  This is part of the normal system
    shutdown (at least on Unix and Linux systems) and the exact time
    that <application>apcupsd</application> receives the termination
    signal depends on how the shutdown links (usually in
    <filename>/etc/rc.d</filename>) are set.</para>

    <para>Note that on Windows NT systems,
    <application>apcupsd</application> apparently continues to run as a
    Service even though the machine is &quot;shutdown&quot;.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
     <para>During the shutdown of the system after
     <application>apcupsd</application> has been forced to exit, one
     of the last things done by the system shutdown is to call the
     halt script, which is usually in
     <filename>/etc/rc.d/halt</filename> or
     <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt</filename>, or possibly in
     <filename>/sbin/init.d/rc.0</filename> depending on your
     system. If apcupsd was properly installed, this standard halt
     script was modified to include a bit of new logic just before the
     final halt of the system. It first tests if the file
     <filename>/etc/apcupsd/powerfail</filename> exists, and if it
     does, it executes <command>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol
     killpower</command>. It is this last step that will cause
     <application>apcupsd</application> to be re-executed with the
     <option>--killpower</option> option on the command line. This
     option tells <application>apcupsd</application> to inform the UPS
     to kill the power.</para>

     <para>This final step is important if you want to ensure that your
     system will automatically reboot when the power comes back on. The
     actual code used on the Red Hat version is:</para>

<programlisting>
# See if this is a powerfail situation.                             # ***apcupsd***
if [ -f /etc/apcupsd/powerfail ]; then                              # ***apcupsd***
 echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
 echo &quot;APCUPSD will now power off the UPS&quot;                          # ***apcupsd***
 echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
 /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol killpower                                  # ***apcupsd***
 echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
 echo &quot;Please ensure that the UPS has powered off before rebooting&quot; # ***apcupsd***
 echo &quot;Otherwise, the UPS may cut the power during the reboot!!!&quot;   # ***apcupsd***
 echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
fi                                                                  # ***apcupsd***
</programlisting>
    </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The above code must be inserted as late as possible in the halt
script. On many systems, such as Red Hat, all the disk drives were
unmounted, then remounted read-only, thus permitting access to the
<filename>/etc</filename> files and the
<application>apcupsd</application> executable. If your system does not
explicitly remount the disks, you must remount them in read-only mode
in the code that you add. Examples of code fragments that do this can
be found in the <filename>distributions/suse</filename> subdirectory
of the source.</para>

<para>If you are not able to insert the above code in your halt script
because there is no halt script, or because your halt script calls the
<application>init</application> program as some Unix systems do, you
can either just forget about powering off the UPS, which means that
your machine will not automatically reboot after a power failure, or
there is yet another alternative, though not at all as satisfying as
inserting code in the halt script.</para>

<para>Only if you cannot insert the appropriate code in the halt
script, when you start <application>apcupsd</application>, normally
from the <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/apcupsd</filename> script, use the
<option>--kill-on-powerfail</option> option. This will cause
<application>apcupsd</application> to program the UPS to shutoff the
power just before it (<application>apcupsd</application>) does the
system shutdown. Please note that this is not the most ideal solution.
Read on to understand why.</para>

<para>A very important consideration is that you must set the EEPROM
in your UPS so that it waits a sufficient time for the system to
halt before it shuts off the UPS power. The current value as well
as the permitted values for your UPS can be determined by
executing:</para>

<programlisting>
apcaccess eeprom
</programlisting>

<para>The output should look something like the following:</para>

<para>The line of interest for you is the <emphasis
role="bold">Shutdown grace delay</emphasis>, which can be changed
using the <link linkend="SLEEP">SLEEP</link> directive in your <emphasis
role="bold">apcupsd.conf</emphasis> file. The default value is 20
seconds, but generally, you can set it to 180, 300, or 600 seconds
depending on your UPS. See the <link linkend='eeprom'>EEPROM</link> this
manual for further details on how to change this EPROM value.</para>

<para>If you use the <option>--kill-on-powerfail</option> option, you
run the risk of having the computer power cut before the system has
shutdown. Even if the grace period is rather long, if something goes
wrong in the shutdown, well, it is up to you to decide.</para>

<para>If <application>apcupsd</application> has successfully shutdown
your computer and powered off the UPS during a power outage, you can
control whether or not your computer is automatically rebooted when
the power returns.</para>

<para>The UPS contains two internal EPROM values that determine when
it will restore power to your computer after a full power shutdown.
They are the <link linkend="RETURNCHARGE">RETURNCHARGE</link>
percentage and the <link linkend="WAKEUP">WAKEUP</link>
delay. Briefly, the <emphasis role="bold">RETURNCHARGE</emphasis>
specifies what percentage charge the battery must have before the
power is restored. Higher values are recommended in regions where the
power goes up and down frequently. The <emphasis
role="bold">WAKEUP</emphasis> delay is a simple time delay. Most sites
will have both of these at zero, or perhaps the <emphasis
role="bold">RETURNCHARGE</emphasis> set to 15. Please follow the links
to the <emphasis role="bold">Configuration</emphasis> section of this
manual for more information.  See the <link linkend='eeprom'>EEPROM</link> of
this manual for further details on how to change these EPROM
values.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Shutdown Problems</title>

<para>Obviously if your halt script is not properly modified,
<application>apcupsd</application> will not be able to shut off the
power to the UPS, and if the power returns before the batteries are
exhausted your system will not automatically reboot. In any case, your
machine should have been cleanly shut down. </para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Master/Slave Shutdown</title>

<para>In master/slave configurations, however, the master cannot be
100 percent sure that the slaves have all shutdown before it performs
the power off. As a consequence, it is possible that the master will
shut off the power before the slave has finished shutdown. If this is
the case, the best procedure is to put an appropriate sleep command in
the <filename>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</filename> file on the master.
For example to give the slaves 30 additional seconds to shutdown, one
would add:</para>

<programlisting>
sleep 30
</programlisting>

<para>just after the line that reads</para>

<programlisting>
doshutdown)
</programlisting>

<para>in the <filename>apccontrol</filename> file (approximately line
79 &mdash; depending on your system version).</para>

<para>Also, on a slave machine, you do not want to use the modified
halt script since it will recall <application>apcupsd</application>,
which will detect that it is a slave (i.e. no connection to the UPS)
and will complain that it cannot do the killpower. This situation is
not harmful just annoying and possibly confusing.</para>

<para>One possible problem during shutdown can be caused by remnants
of old versions. Please be sure to delete or rename all prior versions
(<filename>/usr/local/sbin/apcupsd</filename> or
<filename>/sbin/powersc</filename>).</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Startup</title>

<para>Normally, <application>apcupsd</application> is automatically
started when your system is rebooted. This normally occurs because the
startup script <application>apcupsd</application> is linked into the
appropriate places in <filename>/etc/rc.d</filename>. On most Linux
systems, there is a program called
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>chkconfig</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
that will automatically link the startup script.  This program is
invoked by the <command>make install</command> scripts, or it is
explicitly done for those systems that do not have
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>chkconfig</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>. If
this is not the case, you can either link it in appropriately yourself
or explicitly call it from your rc.local file. The appropriate manual
way to startup <application>apcupsd</application> is by
executing:</para>

<programlisting>
&lt;path&gt;/apcupsd start
</programlisting>

<para>where &lt;path&gt; is normally <filename>/etc/rc.d</filename> or
<filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename> depending on your system (isn't
Unix wonderful? :-)). Using this script is important so that any files
remaining around after a power failure are removed. Likewise, shutting
down <application>apcupsd</application> should be done with the same
script: </para>

<programlisting>
&lt;path&gt;/apcupsd stop
</programlisting>

<chapter id='upsbible'><title>APC's smart protocol</title>

<para>The APC UPS protocol was originally analyzed by Pavel Korensky
with additions from Andre H. Hendrick beginning in 1995, and we want
to give credit for good, hard work, where credit is due. After having
said that, you will see that Steven Freed built much of the orginal
<application>apcupsd</application> information file. [Comment inserted
by Riccardo Facchetti]</para>

<para>The start of this chapter of the
<application>apcupsd</application> manual in HTML format was pulled
from the <ulink
url="http://www.exploits.org/nut/library/apcsmart.html">Network UPS
Tools (NUT)</ulink> site. It has been an invaluable tool in improving
<application>apcupsd</application>, and I consider it the <emphasis
role="bold">Bible</emphasis> of APC UPS programming. In the course of
using it, I have added information gleaned from
<application>apcupsd</application> and information graciously supplied
by APC. Hopefully, the additions made herein can benefit the original
author and his <ulink url="http://www.exploits.org/nut">programming
project</ulink>, and maybe some day, the
<application>apcupsd</application> project and the <emphasis
role="bold">NUT</emphasis> project can join forces.</para>

<sect1><title>Description</title>

<para>Here's the information on the elusive APC smart signaling protocol
used by their higher end units (Back-UPS Pro, Smart-UPS,
Matrix-UPS, etc). What you see here has been collected from a
variety of sources. Some people analyzed the chatter between
PowerChute and their hardware. Others sent various characters to
the UPS and figured out what the results meant.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>RS-232 differences</title>

<para>Normal 9 pin serial connections have TxD on 3 and RxD on 2. APC's
smart serial ports put TxD on pin 1 and RxD on pin 2. This means
you go nowhere if you use a normal straight through serial cable.
In fact, you might even power down the load if you plug one of
those cables in. This is due to the odd routing of pins - DTR and
RTS from the PC usually wind up driving the on/off line. So, when
you open the port, they go high and *poof* your computer dies.</para>

<para>Originally this evil hack was used to connect the UPS to the PC
when this page was first being built. As you can see, I cheated and
neglected the ground (only 2 wires!) and it still worked. This
method can be used for playing around, but for professional systems
this is obviously not a viable option.</para>

<para>That hack didn't work out so well (damned cats), so it was
retired quite awhile back. The most practical solution was to go
out and BUY the DOS/Win version of PowerChute just for the black
(smart) cable. I recommend doing the same thing if you actually
care about this thing working properly. Of course, if you have one
of the newer packages that came with PowerChute, you already have
the cable you need.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Diagram for cable hackers</title>

<para>If you are handy with cable creation tools, check out the <ulink
url="http://www.exploits.org/nut/library/940-0024C.jpg">940-0024C
clone diagram</ulink>. That's the black &quot;smart&quot; cable
normally provided with APC models sold after 1996. The loopback pins
on that diagram are used to keep PowerChute happy by allowing cable
detection. If you use the <ulink
url="http://www.exploits.org/nut/">NUT</ulink> apcsmart driver, those
pins don't matter.</para>

<para>Many thanks to Steve Draper for providing this scan.</para>

<sect1><title>The Smart Protocol</title>

<para>Despite the lack of official information from APC, this table has
been constructed. It's standard RS-232 serial communications at
2400 bps/8N1. Don't rush the UPS while transmitting or it may stop
talking to you. This isn't a problem with the normal single
character queries, but it really does matter for multi-char things
like &quot;@000&quot;. Sprinkle a few calls to usleep() in your code and
everything will work a lot better.</para>

<para>The following table describes the single character <emphasis
role="bold">Code</emphasis> or command that you can send to the UPS,
its meaning, and what sort of response the UPS will
provide. Typically, the response shown below is followed by a newline
(\n in C) and a carriage return (\r in C). If you send the UPS a
command that it does not recognize or that is not available on your
UPS, it will normally respond by &quot;NA&quot; for not available,
otherwise the response is given in the &quot;Typical results&quot;
column. &gt;</para>

<para>The first two cases (Ident and Batt date) are somewhat special
in that you tell the UPS you want to change the value, then you
supply 8 characters that are saved in the EEPROM. The last ten item
are programmed by telling the UPS that you want it to cycle to the
next permitted value.</para>

<para>In each case, you indicate to the UPS that you want to change
the EEPROM by first sending the appropriate query command (e.g. &quot;c&quot;
for the UPS ID or &quot;u&quot; for the Upper Transfer voltage. This command
is then immediately followed by the cycle EEPROM command or &quot;-&quot;. In
the case of the UPS Id or the battery date, you follow the cycle
command by the eight characters that you want to put in the EEPROM.
In the case of the other ten items, there is nothing more to
enter.</para>

<para>The UPS will respond by &quot;OK&quot; and approximately 5 seconds later
by a vertical bar (|) to indicate that the EEPROM was changed.</para>
