<H1>Apcupsd a daemon for controlling APC UPSes</H1>
<P><B>Apcupsd </B>can be used for power mangement and controlling most
of APC's UPS models on Unix and Windows machines. Apcupsd works with
most of APC's Smart-UPS models as well as most simple signalling models
such a Back-UPS, and BackUPS-Office. During a power failure,
<B>apcupsd</B> will inform the users about the power failure and that a
shutdown may occur. If power is not restored, a system shutdown will
follow when the battery is exhausted, a timeout (seconds) expires, or
runtime expires based on internal APC calculations determined by power
consumption rates. Apcupsd is licensed under the GPL version 2.

<h2>What is new in Apcupsd version
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54413&package_id=49059&release_id=314194">
3.10.17</a> (18 March 2005)</h2>
<b>Apcupsd</b> version 3.10.17 includes the <b>beta</b> release of
USB support for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD. <i>Please read
"Checking Out Your USB Subsystem (BSD)" in the manual for details on
how to configure these platforms for USB support and for information
on known bugs.</i> Also included in 3.10.17 is improved support for
hibernating USB UPSes and a fix for the slave mode segfault bug
introduced in 3.10.16.
<h2><a href="3.10.x-manual/index.html" target="_top">Online
3.10.x Manual</a> or a
<a href="3.10.x-manual/apcupsd.pdf" target="_top">PDF Version of
the Manual</a> </h2> If you want to learn a bit more about
<b>apcupsd</b>, you can browse the
<a href="3.10.x-manual/index.html" target="_top">manual online</a>.
If you have any corrections/comments to the manual, please send them to me at:
kern (at) sibbald (dot) com. For bug reports and
developer contact, please see below.
If you want a pdf copy of the manual, you can find it
<a href="3.10.x-manual/apcupsd.pdf" target="_top">here</a>,
and finally, if you want one big manual in a single html file,
it can be found
<a href="3.10.x-manual/manual.html" target="_top">here</a>.
<h2>Bugs and Email Support</h2>
Please don't email me directly, it is much better to address bug reports
and questions to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/subscribe/apcupsd-users">
user's mailing list</a>, to which you must
be subscribed, otherwise your email regrettably goes down
the bit bucket -- you can blame the spammers for that. See the
<a href="lists.html">Email Lists page</a> for links and how to subscribe.
<h2>Release Notification and User's Email List</h2>
<p>If you want to be notified by email when new releases are available, please
sign up for the apcupsd-announce mailing list. This is easily accomplished by
following the instructions at:
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/subscribe/apcupsd-announce">

<h2>Other Software for Apcupsd</h2>
David Ranch has developed some very interesting graphing support for APC
UPSes, which works with <b>apcupsd</b>. Using <b>apcupsd's</b> logging
capabilities, David provides setup instructions and scripts to produce
high quality, daily PDF graphs of all the important UPS power conditions.

Apcupsd Hosted on Source Forge</a></h2>
We have moved the release of source and binaries (downloads) to Source
Forge for several reasons: 1. Lack of manpower to maintain several
sites, 2. The excellent Open Software Development services offered by
Source Forge. In addition to hosting all our new releases, the Source
Forge site has a CVS repository where you can find the very latest
development software. Please visit it and become familiar with how it
works.
