     - Implement USB on all *BSD systems. Note, the kernel
       drivers on most of these systems are still fragile.
       There are known problems, for example, on FreeBSD.
     - Fix killpower on USB UPSes to properly turn off UPS.
     - More killpower fixes for BackUPS Pros.
     - Fix killpower sequence for serial UPSes.

<P>
Change Log for current version 

<P>
<PRE>
     ----&gt; Release 3.10.17 xxMar05
     - Update default apcupsd.conf to recommend a blank DEVICE setting for USB
       driver.
     - Add /dev/hiddev? to Linux USB driver device node search path.
     - Add Mac OS X startup script
     - Add new *BSD USB driver to support USB UPSes on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD.
       THIS DRIVER IS BETA SOFTWARE AND HAS A KNOWN LOCKUP ISSUE ON FREEBSD. Please
       keep this in mind when deciding whether or not to deploy it. PLEASE READ THE
       "CHECKING OUT YOUR USB SUBSYSTEM (BSD)" SECTION OF THE MANUAL as it contains
       crucial details on how to configure your system for the new driver.
     - Add BackUPS Pro shutdown code to USB driver
     - Prefer BackUPS style shutdown over SmartUPS in USB driver to resolve shutdown
       issues on BackUPS CS models
     - Restructure USB driver to share common code
     - Fix slave mode segfault bug introduced by --killpower fixes in 3.10.16.
     - Commit kernstodo
     - Added an anonymous patch to powerflute.c and to the slack-apcupsd.in file.
     - Add Whitebox to detected systems.
     - Minor tweak to RedHat spec.in
     - Apply Carl Lindbergs patch
       for apcaction.c to fix the network management card
       shutdown.
     - Fix typo in targets.mak that prevents uninstall from working.
     - Change name of thread_terminate to apc_thread_terminate to avoid
       conflict on AIX.
     - Put configure found SHUTDOWN in apccontrol.in
     - Figured out how to scale the pdf images, so re-did them.
     - Some minor updates to the manual, particularly the title
       page.

<PRE>
     ----&gt; Release 3.10.16 04Nov04
     - Adam has fixed the killpower problem for USB so that the
       USB now properly turns off the power. Nice job.
     - Converted manual from docbook to texinfo format. There is some
       cleanup to be done, but we get an index.
     - Thanks to Adam for converting the .png images to .pdf
     - Apply patch to fix aastr... supplied by Manfred Schwarb.
     - Changed Solaris to use mailx by default at the suggestion of
       Neil Brookins.
     - Added Adam's snoopdecode.c to examples that allows viewing
       USB events.
     - A number of typos fixed in apccontrol files.
     - Adam fixed a race condition in killpower with --kill-on-powerfail.
     - --kill-on-powerfail disallowed for dumb UPSes since the
       kill power will always occur before the system has been halted.
     - Lots of doc updates.
     - Add proper platform code so that configure will create
       the 4 platform specific apccontrol files (some were missing).
     - Apply fix from user to correct one of the shutdown
       sequences for the Smart UPS. During the conversion to drivers
       this was apparently mangled.
     - Added code to close all file descriptors before becoming
       daemon unless debug turned on.
     - Add APCBATTCapBeforeRestore found by Adam to hid-ups.c
     - Update copyright in apc_struct.h
     - Take Adam's new apc_defines.h with minor modification.
     - Correct a bug reported by a user (he also had the fix) to
       the snmp driver where Sensitivity was incorrectly reported.
     - Add astrncpy() to snmp driver.
     - Fix apcstatus.c to report Unknown for the sensitivity rather than
       High if the sense word cannot be read or is incorrect.
     
     ----&gt; Release 3.10.15 07Aug04
     - Document Mandrake USB kernel problems.
     - Fix HID_MAX_USAGES in the examples directory
     - Apply David Walser's patch for missing colors in multimon.  Reads
       the apcupsd.css file from the sysconf directory.
     - Add EEPROM fix from Giuseppe Ghibo passed on by David Walser
     
     ----&gt; Release 3.10.14 28Jul04
     - Add workaround from Adam for linux/hiddev.h missing define.
     - Updates to manual.
     - Integrate patch for Mandrake apcupsd.in forwarded by David Walser.
     - Found another store into the ups buffer so ifdefed it. Cannot
       store into the ups buffer on non-pthreads systems.
     - Fiddle with apcconfig.c to correct astrncpy() problem noted by
       Adam.
     - ifdef code in apcaccess that tries to write in the shared memory
       buffer.
     - Applied Adam's patch for fixing the pthreads dependencies in asys.c
     - Tweak the patch a bit hopefully so that OpenBSD will work.
     - Made a sweep through quite a few files updating the copyright,
       eliminating the disclaimer (now in DISCLAIMER), and adding as many
       astrncpy() and astrncat()s as I could find. There still remain some
       drivers and the cgi code to do.
     - Implemented true/false and bool. Started implementing it in many of
       the files I touched.
     - Updated the net driver and did a fairly good testing of it.
     - Made apcupsd remain in the foreground when doing a kill power.
     - Eliminated some of the error messages during kill power by not
       doing useless things.
     - Added back code to print what is happening during kill power
       in the USB code.
     - Corrected a few of the USB error messages that could have been
       missleading or confusing.
     - Eliminated some inappropriate usages of size_t.
     - Integrated a number of updates into the manual, particularly from
       Adam.
     - If the IP address is 0.0.0.0 force it to localhost in apcaccess.
     - Integrat Thomas Habets' changes to keep connect() from blocking
       in apcnet.c so that apcupsd can service more slaves.
     - Ensure that stdin/out/err are allocated in daemon_start() of apcuspd.c
     - Update snmp.c with bug fix from Bacula.
     - Bill has made numerous changes to improve the code such as adding
       consts where appropriate.
     
     ----&gt; Release 3.10.13 20Apr04
     - Added code to support net snmp configured with --enable-net-snmp
       based on patch sent by Sander Siemonsma.
     - Build smtp on Unix systems.
     - Update to most current smtp and make it easier to configure
       for apcupsd or Bacula
     - Start implementing native Win32 version.
     - Rename cmd - ups_event and cmd_msg - event_msg
     - Add user supplied code to make apcaccess read the conf file and
       self configure to proper port. Thanks to Martin Flack for this
       patch.
     - Start simplifying the Copyright and making the dates current.
     - Rework the net driver. It was really in poor shape.
     - Replace sprintf with asnprint. Replace strcpy with astrncpy
     - Apply a fix supplied by Jim Pick where syslog releases the
       usb port and then re-attaches it to /dev/log.
     - I finally took a careful look at the old master/slave networking
       code as well as ran it here, and it was sadly broken. Hopefully
       this commit fixes the problems.
     - Fix a few string functions using the new routines.
     - Added asys.c imported from Bacula, which contains a number of
       simple system routines such as astrncpy(), ...

How To Use This Manual
</H1>
<A NAME="91"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Using-this-Manual-3"></A>This is the manual for apcupsd, a daemon for communicating with UPSes
(Uninterruptible Power Supplies) made by American Power Corporation (APC).  If
you have an APC-made UPS, whether sold under the APC nameplate or OEMed (The
HP PowerTrust 2997A UPS has been tested as a ``smartups'' with cable Hewlett
Packard part number 5061-2575 equivalent to a custom-smart cable), and you
want you get it working with a computer running Linux, Unix, or Windows NT,
you are reading the right document.  

<P>
This manual is divided into parts which increase in technical depth as they
go.  If you have just bought a state-of-the-art smart UPS with a USB or
Ethernet interface, and you are running a current version of Red Hat or SUSE
Linux (8.0 or later), then apcupsd is very nearly plug-and-play and you will
have to read only the Basic User's Guide (see 
<A HREF="#Basic-User_0027s-Guide">Basic User's Guide</A>).  

<P>
If your operating system is older, or if you have an old-fashioned serial-line
UPS, you'll have to read about serial installation (see 
<A HREF="#Installation-on-Serial_002dLine-UPSes">Installation on Serial-Line
UPSes</A>).  If you need more
details about administration for unusual situations (such as a master/slave or
multi-UPS setup) you'll need to read the section on advanced topics (see 
<A HREF="#Advanced-topics">Advanced topics</A>). Finally, there is a
Technical Reference (see 
<A HREF="#Technical-Reference">Technical Reference</A>) section which
gives full details on things like configuration file directives and
event-logging formats.  

<P>
You should begin by reading the Quick Start (see 
<A HREF="#Quick-Start-for-Beginners">Quick Start for Beginners</A>)
instructions.

<A NAME="126"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Quick-Start-7"></A>apcupsd is a complex piece of software, but most of its complexities are meant
for dealing with older hardware and operating systems.  On current hardware
and software getting it running should not be very complicated.  

<P>
The following is a help guide to the steps needed to get apcupsd set up and
running as painlessly as possible.  

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Check to see if apcupsd supports your UPS and cable
   (see <A HREF="#Supported-UPSes">Supported UPSes and Cables</A>).  
</LI>
<LI>Check to see if apcupsd supports your operating system
   (see 
   <A HREF="#Supported-Operating-Systems_003b">Supported Operating Systems</A>).  
</LI>
<LI>Plan your configuration type (see 
   <A HREF="#Choosing-a-Configuration-Type">Choosing a Configuration
   Type</A>).  If you have just one UPS
   and one computer, this is easy.  If you have more than one machine being
   served by the same UPS, or more than one UPS supplying power to computers that
   are on the same local network, you have more choices to make.  
</LI>
<LI>Figure out if you have one of the easy setups.  If you have a USB
   UPS, and a USB-capable recent Linux such as Red Hat or SuSE at version 8.0,
   and you want to use one UPS with one computer, that's an easy setup.  APC
   supplies the cable needed to talk with that UPS along with the UPS. All you
   need to do is check that your USB subsystem is working (see 
   <A HREF="#Checking-Out-Your-USB-Subsystem">Checking Out Your USB
   Subsystem</A>); if so, you can go to
   the build and install step.  
</LI>
<LI>If you have a UPS designed to communicate via SNMP over Ethernet, that
   is also a relatively easy installation. It's in Advanced Topics (see 
   <A HREF="#Advanced-topics">Advanced topics</A>) mainly because it's an
   unusual situation.  
</LI>
<LI>If you have a UPS that communicates via an RS232C serial interface and
   it is a SmartUPS, then things are relatively simple, otherwise, your life is
   about to get interesting.  

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If you have a vendor-supplied cable, find out what cable type you have
   by looking on the flat ends of the cable for a number, such as 940-0020A,
   stamped in the plastic.  Check the cables column of the table of types (see 
   <A HREF="#type_005ftable">type_table</A>) to see if it's a supported
   type.  
</LI>
<LI>If you don't have a vendor-supplied cable, or your type is not
   supported, you may have to build one yourself (see 
   <A HREF="#Cables">Cables</A>).  Here is hoping you are good with a
   soldering iron!  
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Now you are ready to read the Building and Installing (see 
   <A HREF="#Building-and-Installing-apcupsd">Building and Installing
   apcupsd</A>) section of the manual
and follow those directions.  If you are installing from an RPM or some other
form of binary package, this step will probably consist of executing a single
command.  
</LI>
<LI>Tweak your /etc/apcupsd/apcupd.conf file as necessary. Often it will not
   be.  
</LI>
<LI>Change the BIOS settings (see 
   <A HREF="#Arranging-for-Reboot-on-Power_002dUp">Arranging for Reboot on
   Power-Up</A>) on your computer
so that boots up every time it gets power. (This is not the default on most
systems.)  
</LI>
<LI>To verify that your UPS is communicating with your computer and will do
   the right thing when the power goes out, read and follow the instructions in
   the Testing (see 
<A HREF="#Testing-Apcupsd">Testing Apcupsd</A>) section.  
</LI>
<LI>If you run into problems, read the Troubleshooting (see 
   <A HREF="#Troubleshooting-Your-Installation">Troubleshooting Your
   Installation</A>) section of this
manual.  
</LI>
<LI>If you still need help, send a message to the developer's email list 
   <A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="mailto:apcupsd-users at
   lists.sourceforge.net">apcupsd-users at lists.sourceforge.net</A>
describing your problem, what version of apcupsd you
are using, what operating system you are using, and anything else you think
might be helpful.  
</LI>
<LI>Read the manual sections on 
   <A HREF="#Monitoring-and-Tuning-your-UPS">monitoring</A> and 
   <A HREF="#Maintaining-Your-UPS">maintaining</A> your UPS.

<P>
<A NAME="index-Supported-OSes-8"></A><A NAME="index-OSes-Supported-9"></A>Please note that due to the lack of Unix USB API standards, the USB code in
apcupsd works only on Linux and *BSD systems. In addition, at the current
release (3.10.17) the USB support for *BSD systems can at best be considered
BETA due to fragile kernel drivers. Drivers for other OSes can be written, but
it requires someone with a knowledge of the OS and the USB to do so.  (This
lack of a Unix USB API interface is one of the big failings of Unix.  It
occurs in other areas such as the GUI. Many people tout the diversity as an
advantage, but it is in fact a weakness.)  

<P>
The apcupsd maintainers develop it under Fedora (Red Hat); that port is,
accordingly, the most up to date and best tested.  There are enough Debian
Linux users that that port is also generally pretty fresh.  Slackware Linux is
also fully supported.  

<P>
apcupsd has also been ported to FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, HP/UX, Solaris,
Alpha Unix and the Cygwin Unix emulation under Windows. It is quite likely to
work on those systems, though the port may occasionally get stale and require
minor tweaking.

Supported UPSes and Cables

<P>
You can generally count on your UPS being supported if it has either an
Ethernet-connected SNMP interface or a USB interface with an APC-supplied
cable.  

<P>
<A NAME="upstypes"></A>The ``UPSTYPE Keyword'' field is the value you will put in your
/etc/apcupsd/apcupd.conf file to tell apcupsd what type of UPS you have. 
We'll describe the possible values here, because they're a good way to explain
your UPS's single most important interface property - the kind of protocol
it uses to talk with its computer.

   An APCSmart UPS and its computer also communicate through an RS232C serial
connection, but they actually use it as a character channel (2400bps, 8 data
bits, 1 stop bit, no parity) and pass commands back and forth in a primitive
language (see 
<A HREF="#APC-smart-protocol">APC smart protocol</A>) resembling
modem-control codes.  The different APC UPSes all use closely related
firmware, so the language doesn't vary much (later versions add more
commands).  This class of UPS is in decline, rapidly being replaced in APC's
product line by USB UPSes.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>usb</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="269"></A>
   A USB UPS speaks a universal well defined control language over a USB wire. 
Most of APC's lineup now uses this method as of late 2003, and it seems likely
to completely take over in their low- and middle range.  Other manufacturers
(Belkin, Tripp-Lite, etc.) are moving the same way, though with a different
control protocol for each manufacturer.  As long as USB hardware can be
mass-produced more cheaply than an Ethernet card, most UPSes are likely to go
this design route. Please note that even if you have a USB UPS, if you use a
serial cable with it (as can be supplied by APC), you will need to configure
your UPS as <B>apcsmart</B> rather than <B>usb</B>.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>net</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="272"></A>
   This is the keyword to specify if you are using your UPS in Slave mode (i.e.
the machine is not directly connected to the UPS, but to another machine which
is), and it is connected to the Master via an ethernet connection. You must
have apcupsd's Network Information Services NIS turned on for this mode to
work. It is a much simpler form of running a Slave than the old Master/Slave
code.

<DD><A NAME="274"></A>
   A dumb or voltage-signaling UPS and its computer communicate through the
signal lines on an RS232C serial connection.  Not much can actually be
conveyed this way other than an order to shut down. Voltage-signaling UPSes
are obsolete; you are unlikely to encounter one other than as legacy hardware.
If you have a choice, we recommend you avoid simple signalling UPSes.

<P>
The table shown below lists the APC model supported, and the possible kewords
that you would use in the configuration with the listed cables.
See below for more details on the keywords.
Some of the
models, particularly USB enabled models, can be run in multiple modes, so they
may appear more than once in the table. APC is putting out new models at a
furious rate, and so it is very likely that your model is not listed in the
table. If it is USB enabled, it will probably work in USB mode. Please note
that some of these new models are extremely inexpensive, so they are stripped
down versions of more expensive units, and as such they do not offer as many
features, so some of the example output you see elsewhere in this manual may
not be available with your unit.

Choosing a Configuration Type
</H1>
<A NAME="348"></A>
There are three major ways of running apcupsd on your system. The first is a
standalone configuration where apcupsd controls a single UPS, which powers a
single computer.  This is the most common configuration.  If you're working
with just one machine and one UPS, skip the rest of this section.  

<P>
Your choices become more interesting if you are running a small cluster or a
big server farm.  Under those circumstances, it may not be possible or even
desirable to pair a UPS with every single machine.  apcupsd supports some
alternate arrangements.  

<P>
The second type of configuration is a master/slave configuration, where one
UPS powers several computers, each of which runs a copy of apcupsd.  The
computer that controls the UPS is called the master, and the other computers
are called slaves.  The master copy of apcupsd communicates with and controls
the slaves via an Ethernet connection.  This type of configuration may be
appropriate for a small cluster of machines.  Some example configuration files
for the master and the slave machines can be found in the examples directory
of the source distribution.  The more recent examples are in
master.apcupsd.conf and slave.apcupsd.conf.  

<P>
The third configuration (new with version 3.8.3), is where a single computer
controls multiple UPSes. In this case, there are several copies of apcupsd on
the same computer, each controlling a different UPS. One copy of apcupsd will
run in standalone mode, and the other copy or copies will normally run in
master/slave mode.  This type of configuration may be appropriate for large
server farms that use one dedicated machine for monitoring and diagnostics  

<P>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Problem</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Linux 2.4 series kernels older than 2.4.22 (RH 9, RHEL 3) do not bind the
USB device to the proper driver. This is evidenced by /proc/bus/usb/devices
listing the UPS correctly but it will have ``driver=(none)'' instead of
``driver=(hid)''. This affects RHEL3, among others.  
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Workaround</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Upgrade linux kernel to 2.4.22 or higher. Alternately, you apply the
linux-2.4.20-killpower.patch and linux-2.4.20-USB-reject.patch patches
to your kernel and rebuild it. These patches can be found in the examples/
directory in the apcupsd source distribution.

<DT><STRONG>Problem</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Mandrake 10.0 and 10.1 systems with high security mode

Checking Out Your Linux USB Subsystem

<LI>That the correct device nodes are available in /dev

</H3>

<P>
To make sure that your USB subsystem can see the UPS, just do this from a
shell prompt:

<P>
<PRE>
     cat /proc/bus/usb/devices
</PRE>

<P>
This information is updated by the kernel whenever a device is plugged in or
unplugged, irrespective of whether apcupsd is running or not. It contains
details on all the USB devices in your system including hubs (internal and
external), input devices, and UPSes.

<P>
You should get some output back that includes something like this, featuring
a BackUPS RS 1000: 

<P>

</PRE>

<P>
The important things to check for are the <B>S:</B> lines describing your
UPS and and the <B>I:</B> line showing what driver is handling it.
If on the <B>I:</B> line, <B>Driver</B> is listed as <B>Driver=none</B> then
you do not have the HID driver loaded or the driver did not attach to the UPS.
One common cause is having a Linux kernel older than 2.4.22 (such as a stock
RedHat 9 or RHEL 3 kernel). If this is the case for your system, please
upgrade to at least kernel version 2.4.22 and try again. If you are already
running a 2.4.22 or higher kernel, please read further for instructions for
other possible courses of action.  

<P>
For a detailed description of the contents of the /proc/bus/usb files, see
<A HREF="#proc_usb_info-2.4">Interpreting /proc/bus/usb (linux-2.4)</A> or

appropriate for your kernel version.

<P>
Here is another example, this time featuring a Back-UPS 350:

     E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   8 Ivl= 10ms
</PRE>

<P>
In general, if you see your UPS model in the <B>S:</B> field, which means
<B>Manufacturer=</B>, <B>Product=</B>, and <B>SerialNumber=</B>, and you see
<B>Driver=hid</B> in the <B>I:</B> field, you know the UPS has been recognized
and is bound to the correct driver.

<P>
If your UPS doesn't appear in the list at all, check the obvious things:
The UPS must be powered on, and a cable must be properly seated in both the
data port of the UPS and one of your machine's USB ports. Many UPSes have 
phone ports to provide surge protection for phones or modems - make
sure you haven't plugged your USB cable into one of those rather than the
data port (which will usually be near the top edge of the case.)  

<P>
Also, ensure that the correct drivers are loaded. Under Linux-2.4.x, you can
check this out easily by examining the /proc/bus/usb/drivers file.  Here's
how you can do that: 

<P>
<PRE>
     cat /proc/bus/usb/drivers
</PRE>

<P>
...and you should get:

<P>
<PRE>
             usbdevfs
             hub
     96-111: hiddev
             hid
</PRE>

<P>
On Linux-2.6.x, make sure the sysfs filesystem is mounted on /sys and do: 

<P>
<PRE>
     ls -l /sys/bus/usb/drivers/
</PRE>

<P>
...where you should get:

<P>
<PRE>
     total 0
     drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root            0 May  1 18:55 hid

     drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root            0 May  1 18:55 usbfs

     drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Jan  6 15:28 usbhid
</PRE>

<P>
If your 2.6.x system does not have the /sys/bus/usb directory, either you do
not have sysfs mounted on /sys or the USB module(s) have not been loaded. 
(Check /proc/mounts to make sure sysfs is mounted.)  

<P>
A USB UPS needs all of these drivers - the USB device filesystem, the USB
hub, the Human Interface Device subsystem driver, and the Human Interface
Device driver. If you are compiling your own kernel, you want to enable

<P>
<PRE>
     CONFIG_USB
     CONFIG_USB_HID
     CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV
     CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS
</PRE>

<P>

Device Nodes
</H3>

<P>
Apcupsd accesses USB UPSes via the hiddev device nodes. Typically these are
located in /dev/hiddev<I>N</I>, /dev/usb/hiddev<I>N</I> or
/dev/usb/hiddev/hiddev<I>N</I> (where <I>N</I> is a digit 0 thru 9). Some 
distributions (some Debian releases, possibly others) do not provides these
device nodes for you, so you will have to make them yourself. Check /dev, 
/dev/usb, and /dev/usb/hiddev and if you  cannot find the hiddev<I>N</I> nodes,
run (as root) the examples/make-hiddev script from the apcupsd source distribution.

<P>
To complicate things more, many Linux flavors running 2.6 kernels such as
Fedora FC3 use the udev utility, which dynamically creates the devices in /dev
on the fly as they are needed. It is basically a hotplug system, giving a lot
more power to the user to determine what happens when a device is probed or 
opened. It is also a lot more complicated.  

<P>
Some default udev rule sets do not include rules for creating hiddev nodes.
The bottom line for apcupsd on such a system is that if the
hiddev<I>N</I> is not created when you plug in your UPS, apcupsd will terminate
with an error. The solution to the problem is to add a rule to the udev rules
file.  On Fedora FC3, this file is found in /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules.
Start by adding the following line:

<P>
<PRE>
     BUS="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}="051d", NAME="usb/hiddev%n"
</PRE>

<P>
Then either reboot your system, or unplug and replug your UPS and then restart
apcupsd. At that point a /dev/usb/hiddev<I>N</I> node should appear and apcupsd
should work fine.  You can use: 

<P>
<PRE>
     udevinfo -a -p /sys/class/usb/hiddev0/
</PRE>

<P>
to get more information on the fields that can be matched.

<P>
You can also create a more generic rule that creates nodes for any device
using the hiddev driver, not just APC UPSes:

<P>
<PRE>
     KERNEL="hiddev*", NAME="usb/hiddev%n"
</PRE>

<P>
If you have several UPSes or you just want to give your UPS a fixed name, you
can use: 

<P>
<PRE>
     BUS="usb", SYSFS{serial}="AS0123456789", NAME="usb/ups0"
</PRE>

<P>
where you replace the serial number in quotes with the one that correspnds to
your UPS. Then whenever you plug in your UPS it will be given a device node
called usb/ups0.

<P>
An additional device-node-related problem is the use of dynamic minors. Some
distributions, such as Mandrake 10, ship with a kernel having
CONFIG_USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS turned on. This is not ideal for running with
apcupsd, and the easiest solution is to turn CONFIG_USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS off
and rebuild your kernel, or find a pre-built kernel with it off. For a kernel with
CONFIG_USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS turned on to work with apcupsd, you must enable
<B>devfs</B>. The following will tell you if devfs is enabled: 

<P>
<PRE>
     $ ps ax | grep devs
</PRE>

<P>
...which should give something like the following: 

<P>
<PRE>
     533 ?        S      0:00 devfsd /dev
</PRE>

<P>
What complicates the situation much more on Mandrake kernels is their security
level since CONFIG_DYNAMIC_USB_MINORS is turned on, but on higher security
levels devfs is turned off. The net result, is that in those situations hiddev
is completely unusable so apcupsd will not work. So, in these cases,
the choices are: 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Reduce the security level setting of the system (not sure if 
    this is possible after the initial install).
</LI>
<LI>Custom build a high security kernel with devfs enabled and make
    sure devfs is mounted and devfsd is running.
</LI>
<LI>Custom build a high security kernel with dynamic minors disabled
</LI>
<LI>Use udev
</LI>
</OL>

Platforms and Versions
</H3>

<P>
The BSD USB driver supports FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. (Thanks go to 
the BSD developers who kept a nearly identical interface across all 
three platforms.)  

<P>
The driver has been tested with the following platform versions: 

<P>
<PRE>
     FreeBSD-5.4     (Primary development platform)
     FreeBSD-5.3
     FreeBSD-4.11
     NetBSD-2.0
     NetBSD-1.6.2
     OpenBSD-3.6
</PRE>

<P>
FreeBSD-5.4 has had the most testing since it is the primary platform on which
the driver is developed. The other platforms and versions have had somewhat
less testing. The only architecture tested so far (on any platform) is i386,
althought there is no reason to think it will not work on other archs. If you
run the driver on a new platform version or architecture, please report your
experience (good or bad) to the apcupsd-users mailing list.

Verifying Device Detection and Driver
</H3>

<P>
After building a properly configured kernel, reboot into that kernel and plug
in your UPS USB cable. You should see a dmesg log message like the following: 

<P>
<PRE>
     ugen0: American Power Conversion Back-UPS RS 1500 FW:8.g6 .D USB FW:g6, rev 1.10/1.06, addr 2
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the <B>ugen</B> driver is called out. If you see <B>uhid</B> instead, it
probably means you did not properly disable the uhid driver when you compiled
your kernel or perhaps you're not running the new kernel.

<P>
You can also check with 'usbdevs -d' to get a list of USB devices recognized
by the system as well as the drivers they are associated with. For example:

Device Nodes
</H3>

<P>
Apcupsd communicates with the UPS through the USB generic device, <B>ugen</B>.
You may or may not need to manually make <B>ugen</B> device nodes in /dev, 
depending on what OS you are using.  

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>FreeBSD</STRONG></DT>
<DD>No manual intervention needed. FreeBSD automatically creates the ugen
nodes on demand.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>NetBSD</STRONG></DT>
<DD>By default, NetBSD only creates nodes for the first ugen device, <B>ugen0</B>.
Check "<B>usbdevs -d</B>" to see which device your UPS was bound to and then
create the appropriate node by running "<B>cd /dev ; ./MAKEDEV ugenN</B>",
where <B>ugenN</B> is the ugen device name shown by usbdevs. It is probably
a good idea to create several sets of ugen nodes in case you add more USB
devices.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Similar to NetBSD, OpenBSD creates nodes for <B>ugen0</B> and <B>ugen1</B>.
Check "<B>usbdevs -d</B>" to see which device your UPS was bound to and then
create the appropriate node by running "<B>cd /dev ; ./MAKEDEV ugenN</B>",

<P>
<A NAME="index-Installing_002c-Red-Hat-20"></A>For Red Hat systems, apcupsd is available in binary RPM format.  This is the
simplest way to install. If you have no previous version of apcupsd on your
machine and are creating a standalone configuration, simply install the RPM
with a normal <TT>rpm -ihv</TT> command. You're done, and can now skip the rest
of this chapter and go straight to tweaking your run-time configuration file.
(see 
<A HREF="#After-Installation">After Installation</A>)  

<P>
If you have a previous installation, you can upgrade with a normal <TT>rpm
-Uhv</TT>, but this may not upgrade the halt script. It may be better to do the
upgrade as a remove (<TT>rpm -e</TT>) foll;owed by a fresh install (<TT>rpm
-ihv</TT>).  

<P>
After installation of the binary RPM, please verify carefully that
/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt was properly updated and contains new script lines
flagged with <B>***APCUPSD***</B>.  

<P>
Since there is no standard location for cgi-bin, the rpm will place the binary
CGI programs in the directory /etc/apcupsd/cgi. To actually use them, you must
copy or move them to your actual cgi-bin directory, which on many systems is
located in /home/httpd/cgi-bin.

Installation from Source
</H2>
<A NAME="557"></A>

<P>
Installation from source might have to be be done different ways depending on
what system you are running. The basic procedure involves getting a source
distribution, running the configuration, rebuilding, and installing.  

<P>
The basic installation from a tar source file is rather simple:  

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Unpack the source code from its tar archive.  
</LI>
<LI>Go into the directory containing the source code.  
</LI>
<LI>Run <TT>./configure</TT> (with appropriate options as described below)  
</LI>
<LI>make  
</LI>
<LI>su (i.e. become root)  
</LI>
<LI>Stop any running instance of apcupsd.  The command to do this will look
   like <TT>&lt;system-dependent-path&gt;/apcupsd stop</TT>  
</LI>
<LI>uninstall any old apcupsd This is important since the default install
   locations may have changed.  
</LI>
<LI>make install  
</LI>
<LI>edit your /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf file if necessary  
</LI>
<LI>ensure that your halt script is properly updated  
</LI>
<LI>Start the new apcupsd with: <TT>&lt;system-dependent-path&gt;/apcupsd
   start</TT>  
   
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
If all goes well, the <TT>./configure</TT> will correctly determine which
operating system you are running and configure the source code appropriately.
<TT>configure</TT> currently recognizes the systems listed below in the 
<A HREF="#Operating-System-Specifics">Operating System Specifics</A>
section of this chapter and adapts the configuration appropriately.  Check
that the configuration report printed at the end of the <TT>configure</TT>
process corresponds to your choice of directories, options, and that it has
correctly detected your operating system.  If not, redo the <TT>configure</TT>
with the appropriate options until your configuration is correct.  

<P>
Please note that a number of the <TT>configure</TT> options preset apcupsd.conf
directive values in an attempt to automatically adapt apcupsd as best possible
to your system.  You can change the values in apcupsd.conf at a later time
without redoing the configuration process by simply editing the apcupsd.conf
file.  

<P>
Other configuration options can be used to set up the installation of HTML
documentation and optional modules, notably the CGI interface that enables the
UPS state to be queried via the Web and the optional powerflute curses-based
control panel.  Still others enable features such as thread support.  You will
find a complete reference later in this chapter.  

<P>
In general, you will probably want to supply a more elaborate <TT>configure</TT>
statement to ensure that the modules you want are built and that everything is
placed into the correct directories.  

<P>
On Red Hat, a fairly typical configuration command would look like the
following: 

<P>
<PRE>
     CFLAGS="-g -O2" LDFLAGS="-g" ./configure \
       --enable-usb \
       --with-upstype=usb \
       --with-upscable=usb \
       --prefix=/usr \
       --sbindir=/sbin \
       --with-cgi-bin=/var/www/cgi-bin \
       --enable-cgi \
       --with-css-dir=/var/www/docs/css \
       --with-log-dir=/etc/apcupsd \
       --enable-pthreads \
       --enable-powerflute
</PRE>
<P>
By default, <TT>make install</TT> will install the executable files in /sbin, the
manuals in /usr/man, and the configuration and script files in /etc/apcupsd.
In addition, if your system is recognized, certain files such as the startup
script and the system halt script will be placed in appropriate system
directories (usually subdirectories of /etc/rc.d).

</H2>
<A NAME="582"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Verifying-Source-22"></A><A NAME="index-Installing_002c-Source-23"></A>There are a number of things that you can do to check if the installation
(make install) went well. The fist is to check where the system has installed
apcupsd using <TT>which</TT> and <TT>whereis</TT>. On my Red Hat system, you should
get the following (lines preceded with a $ indicate what you type): 

<P>
<PRE>
     $ which apcupsd
     /sbin/apcupsd
     $ whereis apcupsd
     apcupsd: /sbin/apcupsd /etc/apcupsd /etc/apcupsd.conf
     /etc/apcupsd.status /usr/man/man8/apcupsd.8.gz
     /usr/man/man8/apcupsd.8
</PRE>
<P>
If you find an apcupsd in /usr/sbin, /usr/local/sbin, /usr/lib, or another
such directory, it is probably a piece of an old version of apcupsd that you
can delete. If you are in doubt, delete it, then rerun the <TT>make install</TT>
to ensure that you haven't deleted anything needed by the new apcupsd.  Please
note that the files specified above assume the default installation locations.

<P>
As a final check that the <TT>make install</TT> went well, you should check your
halt script (in /etc/rc.d on SUSE systems, and in /etc/rc.d/init.d on Red Hat
systems) to see that the appropriate lines have been inserted in the correct
place. Modification of the halt script is important so that at the end of the
shutdown procedure, apcupsd will be called again to command the UPS to turn
off the power. This should only be done in a power failure situation as
indicated by the presence of the /etc/powerfail file, and is necessary if you
want your machine to automatically be restarted when the power returns. On a
Red Hat system, the lines containing the <TT># ***apcupsd***</TT> should be
inserted just before the final halt command: 

<P>
<PRE>
     # Remount read only anything that's left mounted.
     #echo "Remounting remaining filesystems (if any) readonly"
     mount | awk '/ext2/ { print $3 }' | while read line; do
         mount -n -o ro,remount $line
     done
     
     # See if this is a powerfail situation.                               # ***apcupsd***
     if [ -f /etc/apcupsd/powerfail ]; then                                # ***apcupsd***
        echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
        echo "APCUPSD will now power off the UPS"                          # ***apcupsd***
        echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
        /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol killpower                                  # ***apcupsd***
        echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
        echo "Please ensure that the UPS has powered off before rebooting" # ***apcupsd***
        echo "Otherwise, the UPS may cut the power during the reboot!!!"   # ***apcupsd***
        echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
     fi                                                                    # ***apcupsd***
     
     # Now halt or reboot.
     echo "$message"
     if [ -f /fastboot ]; then
      echo "On the next boot fsck will be skipped."
     elif [ -f /forcefsck ]; then
      echo "On the next boot fsck will be forced."
     fi
</PRE>
<P>
The purpose of modifying the system halt files is so that apcupsd will be
recalled after the system is in a stable state. At that point, apcupsd will
instruct the UPS to shut off the power. This is necessary if you wish your
system to automatically reboot when the mains power is restored. If you prefer
to manually reboot your system, you can skip this final system dependent
installation step by specifying the <TT>disable-install-distdir</TT> option on
the <TT>./configure</TT> command (see below for more details).  

<P>
The above pertains to Red Hat systems only. There are significant differences
in the procedures on each system, as well as the location of the halt script.
Also, the information that is inserted in your halt script varies from system
to system. Other systems such as Solaris require you the make the changes
manually, which has the advantage that you won't have any unpleasant surprises
in your halt script should things go wrong. Please consult the specific system
dependent README files for more details.  

<P>
Please note that if you install from RPMs for a slave machine, you will need
to remove the changes that the RPM install script made (similar to what is
noted above) to the halt script. This is because on a slave machine there is
no connection to the UPS, so there is no need to attempt to power off the UPS.
That will be done by the master.

<DT><STRONG>--enable-master-slave</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="2447"></A>
   Turns on the master/slave networking code (default). This is sometimes
referred to as the old master/slave code, and is more complicated than using
NIS and the net driver to control Slaves (see below).  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>--enable-apcsmart</STRONG></DT>

disabled.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>--enable-net</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="2451"></A>
   Turns on generation of the NIS network driver for slaves. This is an
alternative to old master/slave code. For the master, this code should be
disabled. For each slave, this is the only driver needed. This driver works by
reading the information from the the configured master using the NIS (Network

<DT><STRONG>--enable-nis</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="2454"></A>
   Turns on the Network Information Server (NIS) code within apcupsd. This is
enabled by default. If you do not want to access the status of the UPS from
the network and you are not controlling any slaves via NIS (enable-net), this
can be disabled.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>--enable-pthreads</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="2455"></A>
   This option enables pthreads support causing apcupsd to be built as a threaded
program rather than forking to create separate processes. apcupsd built in
this fashion is more efficient that the standard version being one third the
data size and less overhead locking and coping shared memory. This option is
<I>highly</I> recommended for Windows builds.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>--with-libwrap=&lt;path&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="2456"></A>
   This option when enabled causes apcupsd to be built with the TCP WRAPPER
library for enhanced security. In most cases, the &lt;path&gt; is optional
since configure will determine where the libraries are on most systems.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>--with-nologin=&lt;path&gt;</STRONG></DT>

<DT><STRONG>--with-nis-port=&lt;port&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="2463"></A>
   This option allows you to specify what port apcupsd will use for the Network
Information Server (the CGI programs). The default is system dependent but
usually 3551 because that port has been officially assigned to apcupsd by the
IANA. This option simply sets the appropriate port in the apcupsd.conf file,
which can be changed at any later time.  

<P>

<DT><STRONG>--with-nisip=&lt;IP-Address&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="2464"></A>
   This option allows you to specify the value that will be placed on then NISIP

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>--disable-install-distdir</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="2468"></A>
   This option modifies the apcupsd Makefiles disable installation of the
distribution (platform) directory. Generally, this used to do a full
installation of apcupsd except the final modification of the operating system
files (normally /etc/rc.d/halt, etc.). This is useful if your operating system
is not directly supported by apcupsd or if you want to run two copies of
apcupsd on the same system. This option can also be used by those of you who
prefer to manually reboot your system after a power failure or who do not want
to modify your system halt files.

<P>
<A NAME="index-FreeBSD-36"></A><A NAME="index-OS_002c-FreeBSD-37"></A>This port is complete and is being used by several users. As of version 3.8.3,
we do not recommend that you compile apcupsd with pthreads enabled. This is
because the current FreeBSD implementation of pthreads runs as a single
process, and thus is less efficient (consumes more CPU time) than the forking
version of apcupsd. We hope to rectify this in a future version by using the
FreeBSD LinuxThreads implementation of pthreads.  

<P>
On the FreeBSD OS, there is no known way for a user program to get control
when all the disks are synced. This is needed for apcupsd to be able to issue
the killpower command to the UPS so that the UPS shuts off the power. To
accomplish the same thing on FreeBSD systems, make sure you have a SmartUPS
and that your UPS shutdown grace period is set sufficiently long so that you
system will power down (usually 2 minutes), the use the <TT>kill-on-powerfail</TT> option on the apcupsd command line.

<P>
<A NAME="index-OpenBSD-42"></A><A NAME="index-OS_002c-OpenBSD-43"></A>Ensure that you read the distributions/openbsd/README file before running
apcupsd. There are some critical differences in how the OpenBSD implementation
operates when the UPS batteries are exhausted. Failure to take this into
account may result in the system not being fully halted when power is lost. 
Please read the comments on the pthreads implementation in the FreeBSD section
above as they may apply equally to OpenBSD.  

<P>
PLEASE NOTE. Due to some deficiencies or errors in the OpenBSD pthreads
libraries, if you build apcupsd on OpenBSD with pthread and a child program is
launched (i.e. mail notification of events), this may cause OpenBSD to freeze
up. The best solution is probably to build without pthread. However, in doing
so, you must realize that the bulk of this manual assumes that pthreads is
enabled, and thus many of the comments about apcaccess will not be applicable.
A second solution that seems to work is to delete all calls to the email
notification routines from apccontrol. In doing so, some users have succeeded
in running apcupsd with pthreads.  

<P>
If you want to know the technical problems with pthreads on OpenBSD, it is as
best we can tell because the pthreads are not real kernel pthreads as on Linux
and Solaris, but rather a user program that makes all I/O non-blocking. So
when apcupds does I/O, the userland pthreads libarary will switch to another
thread if it wants to run. This works fine except that when a child process is
called and it exits, all the blocking/non-blocking statuses of the open file
descriptors in the parent program are reset as blocking -- this causes
chaos and an almost immediate freezing of the program (apcupsd).

If you find bugs, or run into problems that seem to be related to the version

getting the beta running, although we can't promise a quick response.  

<P>
As always, remember testing UPSes can be hazardous to you system, and, apcupsd
<I>may contain bugs that can damage your system and data files!</I> You must
accept all responsibility for running this software. An unexpected power-off
of a running system can be a disaster. As always, make backups of any critical
information before you install this software.  

<P>
Remember, we told you. we'll listen sympathetically if you lose data, but
there will be nothing we can do to help you.  

<P>
Please read the general installation instructions given above before
continuing on with these Solaris-specific instructions. Then come back and
read this section before attempting to build the package.  

<P>
For building the system, we suggest that you run the configure and make
processes as your normal UNIX user ID. The <TT>make install</TT> must be run as
root. But if your normal ID has an environment setup for using the C compiler,
it's simpler to do that than to set up root to have the correct environment.  

<P>
Normally, we support the GCC compiler, but we have also attempted to support
the Solaris workshop compilers and EGCS compilers. Please be aware that if you
do not use GCC, you may experience a few problems.  

<P>
Whichever compiler you do have, please insure that you can execute the
compiler from the command line before running configure. If you do not have an
environment setup to run the compiler first, configure will fail.  

<P>
Before running <TT>./configure</TT>, please be sure that you do not have /usr/ucb
on your path. This may cause the <TT>./configure</TT> to choose the wrong
shutdown program. If <TT>./configure</TT> detects that /usr/usb is on your path,
it will print a warning message. Please follow the advice to avoid shutdown
problems.  

<P>
Your normal UNIX user ID must own the source tree directories, and you must
have the normal development tools in your path. This includes make, the
compiler, the M4 preprocessor, the linker, and ar or ranlib. If the user you
are logged in as can compile and link a C program from a source file, then you
have all the required tools available.  

<P>
You will want to install the executables in a directory that remains mounted
during the shutdown. Solaris will unmount almost everything except the root
directories. Since the ability to power the UPS off requires access to the
executable programs, they need to be in a directory that will never be
unmounted. And since they should also be in a directory that normal users
cannot get into, /sbin is the default. However, please be aware that if you
want to follow Sun's filesystem conventions you would use the following: 

<P>
<PRE>
     ./configure \
        --prefix=/opt/apcupsd \
        --sbindir=/etc/opt/apcupsd/sbin \
        --sysconfdir=/etc/opt/apcupsd \
        --with-cgi-bin=/opt/apcupsd/cgi-bin
</PRE>
<P>
The way to setup the /sbin directory as the executables directory is to pass
configure the <B>sbindir=/sbin</B> option. No other arguments should be
required, and your setup and platform should be detected automatically by
configure.  

<P>
Once you have run configure, you will need to do a <TT>make</TT>.  Once the make
has completed with no errors, you must su to root to complete the install.
After the su, you may not have a path to the make program anymore. In that
case, you should do the <TT>make install</TT> step as: 

<P>
<PRE>
     /usr/ccs/bin/make install
</PRE>
<P>
Once the install completes, you must edit the /sbin/rc0 script as detailed
below, then exit from the su'ed shell.  

<P>
In order to support unattended operation and shutdown during a power failure,
it's important that the UPS remove power after the shutdown completes. This
allows the unattended UPS to reboot the system when power returns by
re-powering the system. Of course, you need autoboot enabled for your system
to do this, but all Solaris systems have this by default. If you have disabled
this on your system, please re-enable it.  

<P>
To get the UPS to remove power from the system at the correct time during
shutdown, i.e., after the disks have done their final sync, we need to modify
a system script. This script is /sbin/rc0.  

<P>
We do not have access to every version of Solaris, but we believe this file
will be almost identical on every version. Please let us know if this is not
true.  

<P>
At the very end of the /sbin/rc0 script, you should find lines just like the
following: 

<P>
<PRE>
     # unmount file systems. /usr, /var and /var/adm are not unmounted by umountall
     # because they are mounted by rcS (for single user mode) rather than
     # mountall.
     # If this is changed, mountall, umountall and rcS should also change.
     /sbin/umountall
     /sbin/umount /var/adm &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;\&amp;1
     /sbin/umount /var &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;\&amp;1
     /sbin/umount /usr &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;\&amp;1
     
     echo 'The system is down.'
</PRE>
<P>
We need to insert the following lines just before the last 'echo': 

<P>
<PRE>
     #see if this is a powerfail situation
     if [ -f /etc/apcupsd/powerfail ]; then
             echo
             echo "APCUPSD will power off the UPS"
             echo

<P>
We have included these lines in a file called rc0.solaris in the
distributions/sun subdirectory of the source tree. You can cut and paste them
into the /sbin/rc0 file at the correct place, or yank and put them using vi or
any other editor. Note that you must be root to edit this file.  

<P>
You must be absolutely sure you have them in the right place. If your
/sbin/rc0 file does not look like the lines shown above, do not modify the
file. Instead, email a copy of the file to the maintainers, and we will
attempt to figure out what you should do. If you mess up this file, the system
will not shut down cleanly, and you could lose data. Don't take the chance.  

<P>
This feature has only been tested with APC SmartUPS models. If you do not have
a SmartUPS, you will be one of the first testers to try this feature. Please
send email to let us know if it works with your UPS model, what model you
have, and if possible, the event logs located in /etc/apcupsd. We'd be very
interested in your results, and would be glad to work with you to get this
feature working correctly with all the APC models. A detailed description of
the screen output during the shutdown would be very helpful if you see
problems.  

<P>
You will then need to make the normal changes to the /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
file. This file contains the configuration settings for the package. It is
important that you set the values to match your UPS model and cable type, and
the serial port that you have attached the UPS to.  People have used both
/dev/ttya and /dev/ttyb with no problems. You should be sure that logins are
disabled on the port you are going to use, otherwise you will not be able to
communicate with the UPS. If you are not sure that logins are disabled for the
port, run the 'admintool' program as root, and disable the port. The
'admintool' program is a GUI administration program, and required that you are
running CDE, OpenWindows, or another XWindows program such as KDE.  

<P>
Solaris probes the serial ports during boot, and during this process, it
toggles some handshaking lines used by dumb UPSes. As a result, particularly
for simple signalling ``dumb'' UPSes it seems to kick it into a mode that
makes the UPS think it's either in a calibration run, or some self-test mode.
Since at this point we are really not communicating with the UPS, it's pretty
hard to tell what happened. But it's easy to prevent this, and you should.
Disconnect the UPS, and boot the system. When you get to a login prompt, log
in as root. Type the following command: 

<P>
<PRE>
     eeprom com1-noprobe=true
</PRE>
<P>
or 

<P>
<PRE>
     eeprom com2-noprobe=true
</PRE>
<P>
depending on which com port your UPS is attached to. Then sync and shutdown
the system normally, reattach the UPS, and reboot. This should solve the
problem. However, we have some reports that recent versions of Solaris (7 &amp;
8) appear to have removed this eeprom option and there seems to be no way to
suppress the serial port probing during boot.  

<P>
At this point, you should have a complete installation. The daemon will load
automatically at the next boot. Watch for any error messages during boot, and
check the event logs in /etc/apcupsd. If everything looks OK, you can try
testing the package by removing power from the UPS. NOTE! if you have a
voltage-signalling UPS, please run the first power tests with your computer
plugged into the wall rather than into the UPS. This is because dumb
serial-port UPSes have a tendency to power off if your configuration or cable
are not correct.  

<P>
As a user, your input is very helpful in solving problems with the package,
and providing suggestions and future directions for the development of the
package. We are striving to provide a useful package that works across all
platforms, and welcome your feedback.

Checking Your Configuration File
</H2>
<A NAME="894"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Checking-Conf-file-59"></A>Once you have installed apcupsd, either from a binary package or by building
from source, your next step should be to inspect your
/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf file to make sure it is valid.  

<P>
You can read the complete reference on configuration directives (see 
<A HREF="#Configuration-Directive-Reference">Configuration Directive
Reference</A>), but if you are
setting up a normal standalone configuration you should only need to check
(and possibly fix) the first three items listed below.  

<P>
Your UPSTYPE should be the UPS's protocol type: dumb, apcsmart, usb, net,
snmp, or ether.  Your UPSCABLE should be the type of cable you are using.  You
should have gotten both from the table of types (see 
<A HREF="#type_005ftable">type_table</A>); usually they will both be the
string ``usb''.  

<P>
If you have a USB device, it is better not to specify a DEVICE directive by
commenting it out. Apcupsd will automatically search for your device in the
standard places. If you specify a DEVICE, it should be the name of the device
(or device range) that apcupsd is to use to communicate with the UPS.  If
you're using a USB UPS under Linux, you may leave the device name field blank
and apcupsd will search all the standard locations for the UPS. You may also
explicitly specify the device location as either /dev/usb/hid/hiddev[0-15] (on
non-Red-Hat systems) or /dev/usb/hiddev[0-15] (on Red Hat systems), but this
is not recommended.  

<P>
Note that you should enter ``/dev/usb/hiddev[0-15]'' literally as shown.  The
``[0-15]'' expression tells apcupsd to search all hiddev devices until it
finds a UPS. You can restrict the search to a subset of devices by using
something like ``[0-4]'', but keep in mind this will limit apcupsd's ability
to locate the UPS if the kernel relocates it to a different device node, which
happens occasionally during short power failures. Again, it is highly
recommended to leave the DEVICE directive blank and let apcupsd find your
device automatically.  

<P>
If the first time you execute apcupsd, you get a message to the effect that
the Apcupsd USB driver is missing, it means that you most likely forgot to put
<I>--enable-usb</I> on your ./configure command line. If you loaded apcupsd
from an rpm file, you may have selected the wrong one -- please ensure that
the word <I>usb</I> appears in the rpm package name.  

<P>
The next chapter (see 
<A HREF="#Configuration-Examples">Configuration Examples</A>) of this
manual provides you with the essential characteristics of each main type of
configuration file.  After those elements are correct, apcupsd should run, and
then it is only a matter of customization of your setup.

<P>
<A NAME="index-Reboot-on-power-up-60"></A><A NAME="index-Power-up_002c-reboot-61"></A>The final consideration for a automatic reboot after a full power down is to
ensure that your computer will automatically reboot when the power is
restored.  

<P>
This is not the normal behavior of most computers as shipped from the factory.
Normally after the power is cut and restored, you must explicitly press a
button for the power to actually be turned on. You can test your computer by
powering it down; shutting off the power (pull the plug); then plugging the
cord back in. If your computer immediately starts up, good. There is nothing
more to do.  

<P>
If your computer does not start up, manually turn on the power (by pressing
the power on button) and enter your computer's SETUP program (often by
pressing DEL during the power up sequence; sometimes by pressing F10). You
must then find and change the appropriate configuration parameter to permit
instant power on.  

<P>
Normally, this is located under the <B>BOOT</B> menu item, and will be called
something such as <B>Restore on AC/Power Loss</B> or <B>Full-On</B>. The exact
words will vary according to the ROM BIOS provider. Generally you will have
three options: <B>Last State</B>, <B>Power On</B>, and <B>Power Off</B>. Although
<B>Last State</B> should normally work, we recommend setting your computers to
<B>Power On</B>. This means that whenever the power is applied they are on. The
only way to shut them off is to pull the plug or to have a special program
that powers them off (/sbin/poweroff on Linux systems).  

<P>
If after making all the changes suggested above, you cannot get your computer
to automatically reboot, you might examine your halt script
(/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt in the case of Red Hat Linux) and see if the final line
that performs the halt or reboot contains the <TT>-p</TT> option for powering
down the computer. It should not with the logic used by apcupsd, but if it
does, the <TT>-p</TT> option could cause your computer to power off while the UPS
is still suppling power (i.e. before the UPS kills the power).  Depending on
the setting of your BIOS, it may prevent your computer from restarting when
the power returns. As already mentioned, this should not apply, but in case of
problems it is worth a try.

Making sure apcupsd Is Running
</H2>
<A NAME="929"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Checking-running-62"></A>The simplest way to invoke apcupsd is from the command line by entering: 

<P>
<PRE>
     /sbin/apcupsd
</PRE>
<P>
To do so, you must be root. However, normally, you will want apcupsd started
automatically when your system boots. On some systems with installation
support (e.g. SUSE and Red Hat), the installation procedure will create a
script file that you will be automatically invoked when your system reboots.
On other systems, you will have to invoke apcupsd from your rc.local script.  

<P>
On Red Hat systems, this script file that automatically invokes apcupsd on
system start and stops is: /etc/rc.d/init.d/apcupsd  

<P>
To start apcupsd manually (as you will probably do immediately following the
installation), enter the following: 

<P>
<PRE>
     /etc/rc.d/init.d/apcupsd start
</PRE>
<P>
To understand how this file is automatically invoked at system startup and
shutdown, see the man pages for chkconfig(8).  

<P>
On SUSE systems, the script file that automatically invokes apcupsd on system
start and stops is /etc/rc.d/apcupsd  

<P>
To start apcupsd manually (as you will probably do immediately following the
installation), enter the following: 

<P>
<PRE>
     /etc/rc.d/apcupsd start
</PRE>
<P>
Normally, when properly installed, apcupsd will be started and stopped
automatically by your system. Unfortunately, the details are different for
each system. Below, we give the commands for selected systems. Alternatively,
there are simple stopapcupsd and startapcupsd scripts in the examples
directory, or you can modify one of the scripts in the distributions directory
to meet your needs.  

<P>
To stop apcupsd you can do the following:  

<P>
On Red Hat systems: 

<P>
<PRE>
     /etc/rc.d/init.d/apcupsd stop
</PRE>
<P>
On SUSE systems: 

<P>
<PRE>
     /etc/rc.d/apcupsd stop
</PRE>
<P>
Please see the Testing Apcupsd (see

on insuring that apcupsd is running properly.

Please see the list of UPSes versus cables in the beginning of this document

one end of the cable. If you specify the wrong cable, it is very likely that
at the first power failure, your computer will be immediately shutdown. This
is an unfortunate consequence of the dumb signaling mode.  To avoid this,
first replace <B>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</B> with <B>safe.apccontrol</B> found

Note, the main difference from the stand alone configuration is that you have

have specified one or more slave machines.  In this mode of networking, (as
opposed to using the net driver as described several sections below), your
master knows the presence of all the slaves.  They carry on a very explicit
communication, and the slaves are explicitly notified by the master of any
important changes such as a shutdown.  

<P>
There is a simpler form of contolling slaves using the net driver with an
apcupsd NIS server. The simpler form is much easier to configure. See: see

on the slave even if the master is using <B>UPSTYPE dumb</B>. This is
apparently some bug in the new dumb driver.  

<P>
In this configuration, the shutdown will be initiated by the master. It is
also possible to specify BATTERYLEVEL, MINUTES, and TIMEOUT configuration
directives in the Slave machine that will cause the slave to shutdown before
the master. This can often be useful if the slave is less important than the
master and you wish to reduce battery power consumption so that the master can
remain up longer during a power outage.

computer into an NIS slave by configuring with the NIS network driver turned
on <TT><code>--</code>enable-net</TT>. The difference is that the NIS server has no explicit
knowledge of the slaves. The NIS server makes its information available via
the net (NIS), and the NIS slaves read it. When the NIS server is going to
shutdown, it makes the information available to any NIS slave that polls it,
but the NIS server does not explicitly call each NIS slave as is the case in
the Master/Slave networking described several sections above.  

<P>
Running in this configuration, you can use any computer with apcupsd running
the Network Information Server (NIS) as the server.  The NIS slave simply uses
the NIS information to decide when to shutdown.  This is a much simpler mode
than the older master/slave code mentioned above.

The main apcupsd (NIS server) is connected to the UPS and has NIS turned on,
but the configuration is a simple standalone as in the section <B>A Simple
Configuration for a SmartUPS</B>. It doesn't matter how the UPS is connected to
the computer (serial, USB, ...).  

<P>
For the NIS slave computer, you will have a configuration that looks something
like what follows.  What is important is that you get the information from an
<B>ether</B> cable over the network and you must specify the address of a ``NIS
server'' that is running NIS (not the Master/Slave networking described
above). The NIS slave apcupsd will then poll the NIS server at the NETTIME
interval you specify to obtain the status.  

<P>
Here are a few words from Adam Kropelin concerning the difference between the
Master/Slave networking and the NIS-based networking:  

<P>
Think of the difference as push (Master/Slave) vs. pull (NIS-based). In the
case of M/S, the master makes all the shutdown decisions and notifies the
slaves when they are to shut down or when some other interesting event
happens. The slaves just do whatever the master says, whenever the master says
to. On the other hand, with the NIS-based network config you basically
``publish'' the UPS status from one server and then your clients view that
status and make their own decisions.  

<P>
Personally, I like the NIS-based approach because the master knows nothing
about the slaves, thus there are fewer configuration files to keep in sync. I
also like the flexibility of allowing each slave to make its own decision on
when to shut down; some of my old clunker servers take quite a long while to
shut down. There are problems reported occasionally with the M/S approach,
where slaves sometimes lose contact with the master or vice-versa. I know
improvements have been made in that code, but I still like the simplicity of
using NIS.  

<P>
Another thing to think about is how you feel about running a network service
like NIS on your firewall. My network is set up almost identically to yours
and I chose to run the apcupsd ``master'' on a server in the DMZ and have the
firewall just be a client of it. That way I don't have to run NIS on the
firewall apcupsd instance.

<P>
where on the <B>DEVICE</B> directive you replace the <TT>server-network-address</TT> with the fully qualified domain name or IP address of
a machine running apcupsd with NIS enabled (and normally, but not required,
connected to a UPS). The :3551 that follows the NIS server address is the port
to use. The default is 3551, but older versions of apcupsd used port 7000.  

<P>
Please do not confuse this NIS server/slave mode with the old master/slave
network configuration that is described above.  This is a master/slave setup,
but much simpler (the NIS server does not know about the slaves), and any NIS
server, even a slave, can act as a server to a slave that listens to it.  

<P>
The <B>NETTIME</B> directive defines the time interval that the slave uses to
poll the NIS server. If you set this too large, your slave may not see the
change in state of the NIS server before the server has shutdown. Normally,
you have at least 30 seconds of grace time between the time the NIS server
decides to shutdown and the time it no longer responds. Your slave must poll
during this interval.  

<P>
This mode works principally by reading the STATFLAG record that is sent by the
NIS (present in the output of apcaccess). The low 16 bits are the standard APC
status flag, and the upper 16 bits represent the internal state of apcupsd, so
the slave can see when the power fails and know when to shutdown.  

<P>
As with the Master/Slave configuration, any slave run using the Net driver
will shutdown when its own timers expire or when the NIS server shuts down,
whichever occurs first. This means that if you want the slave to shutdown
before the server, you need only set BATTERYLEVEL, or any of the other values
on the slave for a faster shutdown than the values defined on the NIS server.

This indicates that apcupsd is up and running and has started the two

If you do not find that apcupsd is in the above list, the most likely problem

A very disturbing tendance is for some of the newer (Mar 2004) RS and ES UPSes
to have no Voltage information.  This is annoying bug not serious.  On the
other hand, some of those UPSes now have no battery charge information
(BCHARGE).  If BCHARGE is zero in your listing and you are running a Smart or

<A NAME="1142"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Testing_002c-Communications-91"></A><A NAME="index-Communications-Testing-92"></A>At this point, you should ensure that apcupsd is handling the connection to
the UPS correctly. This test assumes you have a UPS that speaks apcsmart
protocol, over either USB or a serial port.  If you have an old-style
voltage-signaling UPS, please skip to the next section (Simulated Power Fail
Test).  

<P>
When apcupsd detects a problem, it generates an EVENT, which consists of
sending a message to the system log then invoking the <B>apccontrol</B> script
(normally in /etc/acpupsd/apccontrol) to handle the event.  

<P>
In order to create an event, remove the serial port plug from the back of your
computer or from the back of the UPS. Within 6 seconds, apcupsd should detect
the lack of serial port communications and broadcast a <TT>wall</TT> message
indicating that the serial port communications was lost:  

<P>
Warning communications lost with UPS lost.  

<P>
At the same time, it sends the same message to the system log and to the
temporary EVENTS file (/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events).  

<P>
Plug the serial port plug back into your computer, and within about 12
seconds, apcupsd should reestablish communications and broadcast and log the
following message:  

<P>
Communications with UPS restored.  

<P>
If these messages are logged but not broadcast, either you have your mesg
permission set to <I>no</I> (see <B>man wall</B> or <B>man mesg</B>), or there is
a problem with apccontrol. If you are running a window manager such as GNOME
and don't have a console window open, you may not receive the <TT>wall</TT>
messages. However, you should find them in your system log file (normally
/var/log/messages and in the temporary EVENTS file,
/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events. For example, to observe these events in the
temporary EVENTS file, you might do a 

<P>
<PRE>
     tail -f /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events

<P>
Note, if you have installed from the RPM, the proper events file may be
/var/log/apcupsd.events. You can find the actual filename by checking your
apcupsd.conf file.

proceeding with additional tests.

<P>
<A NAME="index-Testing_002c-Simulate-Power-Fail-93"></A><A NAME="index-Simulate-Power-Fail-Test-94"></A>At this point, you should verify that in the event of a power fail apcupsd
properly calls apccontrol. This test is appropriate for all models of UPSes
(smart or dumb).  

<P>
To avoid the possibility that apcupsd might shut down your system, locate
where apccontrol resides on your system (normally, /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol.
Move this script to another location e.g. apccontrol.save and replace it with
the script found in examples/safe.apccontrol. When that is done, ensure that
your UPS battery is fully charged and that you have at least 5 minutes of
remaining runtime on the batteries. This can be done by examining the values
of the <B>BATTCHG</B> and <B>TIMELEFT</B> variables in the printout of <TT>apcaccess status</TT>.  

<P>
Athough this should not be necessary, as an extra precaution, you can shutdown
your machine, remove the plug from the UPS you are testing, and plug your
machine into another UPS or directly into the wall. Doing so, will ensure that
the UPS doesn't cut the power to your machine at a bad time. Remember at the
end of the testing to plug your machine back into the UPS.  

<P>
You can also minimize the risk from an unexpected shutdown by using a
journaling filesystem such as Linux's EXT3.  All modern disk drives park
themselves safely when they power down, rather than ploughing up oxide on your
disk's recording surface.  Thus, unexpected power less has to hit very narrow
timing windows in order to trash an EXT3 transaction.  

<P>
To begin the test, pull the power plug from the UPS. The first time that you
do this, psychologically it won't be easy, but after you have pulled the plug
a few times, you may even come to enjoy it. If all goes well, apcupsd should
detect the power failure and print several warning messages. The first should
appear after 5 to 6 seconds and read: 

<P>
<PRE>
     Warning power loss detected.
</PRE>
<P>
Then generally 6 seconds later, apcupsd is sure that it isn't a transient
effect, so it sends: 

<P>
<PRE>
     Power failure. Running on UPS batteries.
</PRE>
<P>
After a few more seconds (total around 15 seconds), plug the power cord back
in and ensure that apcupsd is aware that the power has returned. It should
print: 

<P>
<PRE>
     Power has returned...
</PRE>
<P>
If you do not observe the above messages, please correct the situation before
proceeding. The most likely cause of problems are:  

<P>

<UL>
<LI>apcupsd doesn't recognize the power failure because the configuration
   directives are not correct. E.g. wrong cable.  
</LI>
<LI>The file /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol doesn't exist or is not marked as
   executable. 
   
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
At this point, we recommend that you do a simulated power down of your system.
If you are adventuresome or have been through this before, skip to the next
section in this manual and do the real power fail shutdown. If you continue
with the simulated power down and if all goes well, apcupsd will go through
all the motions without actually shutting down the system. Continue using the
safe apccontrol that you installed. Edit the configuration file apcupsd and
change the value of <B>TIMEOUT</B> from 0 to something like 30. Doing so will
cause apcupsd to attempt to shutdown the system 30 seconds after it detects a
power failure. Once this change has been made, you must stop and restart
apcupsd for the new configuration value to take effect.  

<P>
Once again, pull the power plug, and if all goes as expected, apcupsd should
attempt to shutdown the system about 30 seconds after it detects the power
failure. All the messages should be displayed by <TT>wall</TT> or by the <TT>tail -f</TT> command. The precise message is determined by what is printed in
/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol for the <B>doshutdown</B> event.  Though it varies from
system to system, it will generally be something like: 

<P>
<PRE>
     Beginning Shutdown Sequence
</PRE>
<P>
When apcupsd this message prints, reconnect the power.  apcupsd should detect
that the power has been restored and attempt to cancel the shutdown.

apcupsd.conf with the original files.

or take other precautions before attempting this to avoid the possibility of
lost data due to a problem (I have been through this at least 10 times and
never once had problems, but we all know that someday something will go
wrong).  

<P>
Before proceeding, please ensure that your halt script or the equivalent has

When you are ready to do the test, either simply pull the plug and wait for
the batteries to become exhausted, or set the <B>TIMEOUT</B> configuration
directive to something like 60 so that the system will shutdown before the
batteries are exhausted. We recommend doing the full shutdown without using
<B>TIMEOUT</B> to correctly simulate a real power failure, but the choice is
yours (I did it once here, but now use TIMEOUT 30).  

<P>
If all goes well, your system should be shutdown before the batteries are
completely exhausted and the UPS should be powered off by apcupsd. Please be
aware that if you do the full power down, you must ensure that your UPS is
totally powered off.  Otherwise, it may have been given the command to power
off, but due to a long grace period it is still waiting. If you were to reboot
your computer during the grace period, the UPS could then suddenly turn off
the power (this happened to me). To avoid this problem, always wait for your
UPS to power itself off, or power if off manually before restarting your
computer. On my system, the UPS is configured as at the factory to have a 180
second grace period before shutting off the power. During this type of
testing, 180 seconds <B>seems</B> like an eternity, so please take care to
either wait or manually power off your UPS. To determine what grace period is
programmed into your UPS EEPROM, run <TT>apcaccess eprom</TT> and look at the
``Shutdown grace delay''.

<A NAME="1227"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-apctest-100"></A>apctest is a program that allows you to talk directly to your UPS and run
certain low-level tests, display all know values from the UPS's EEPROM,
perform a battery runtime calibration, program the EEPROM (serial connection
only), and enter in TTY mode with the UPS. Here we describe how to use it for
a USB or apcsmart UPS; see 
<A HREF="#Using-apctest-on-Serial_002dLine-UPSses">Using apctest on Serial-Line
UPSses</A> for a description
of how to use it with a voltage-signalling UPS.  

<P>
Shutdown apcupsd if it is running. Make sure your <B>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</B> file has <B>UPSTYPE smart</B> and <B>UPSCABLE</B> has
one of the smart cables that are supported.  

<P>
Normally apctest will have been built but not installed, so you must execute
it from the &lt;apcupsd-source&gt;/src directory. You can explicitly build
it on Unix with: 

<P>
<PRE>
     cd &lt;apcupsd-source-directory&gt;
     make apctest
     ./apctest
</PRE>
<P>
or on Windows systems with: 

<P>
<PRE>
     make apctestwin32
     ./apctest
</PRE>
<P>
It will read your installed apcupsd.conf configuration (so it knows where to
find the UPS) and then it will present you with the following output: 

<P>

     Hello, this is the apcupsd Cable Test program.
     This part of apctest is for testing Smart UPSes.
     Please select the function you want to perform.
     
     1) Query the UPS for all known values
     2) Perform a Battery Runtime Calibration
     3) Abort Battery Calibration
     4) Monitor Battery Calibration progress
     5) Program EEPROM
     6) Enter TTY mode communicating with UPS
     7) Quit

</PRE>
<P>
Item 1 will probe the UPS for all values known to apcupsd and present them in
rather raw format. This output can be useful for providing technical support
if you are having problems with your UPS.  

<P>
Item 2 will perform a Battery Runtime Calibration. This test will only be
performed if your battery is 100% charged. Running the test will cause the
batteries to be discharged to approximately 30% of capacity. The exact number
depends on the UPS model. In any case, apctest will abort the test if it
detects that the battery charge is 20% or less.  

<P>
The advantage of doing this test is that the UPS will be able to recalibrate
the remaining runtime counter that it maintains in its firmware. As your
batteries age, they tend to hold less of a charge, so the runtime calibration
may not be accurate after several years.  

<P>
We recommend that perform a Battery Calibration about once a year. You should
not perform this calibration too often since discharging the batteries tends
to shorten their lifespan.  

<P>
Item 3 can be used to abort a Battery Calibration in progress, if you some how
became disconnected.  

<P>
Item 4 can be used to restart the monitoring of a Battery Calibration if you
should some how become disconnected during the test.  

<P>
Item 5 is used to program the EEPROM. Please see the 
<A HREF="#Configuration-Directives-Used-to-Set-the-UPS-EPROM">Configuration Directives Used to Set the UPS
EPROM</A> chapter
of this manual for the details.  

<P>
Item 6 will initiate a direct communication between your terminal and the UPS
at which point, you can enter raw UPS commands. Please be aware that you
should be careful what commands you enter because you can cause your UPS to
suddenly shutdown, or you can modify the EEPROM in a way to disable your UPS.
The details of the raw Smart mode UPS commands can be found in the UPS Bible
(see 
<A HREF="#APC-smart-protocol">APC smart protocol</A>) chapter of this
manual.  

<P>
Item 7 will terminate apctest.

apcaccess output listing, which means with a standard conf file, your system
will be immediately shutdown. To correct this, set the BATTERYLEVEL directive
in your apcupsd.conf file to -1.

the appropriate kernel modules are not getting loaded correctly.  

<P>
You can check this by bringing up your system, fiddling around until you get
apcupsd to work with the UPS, then doing <TT>cat /proc/modules</TT> andnd save

<P>
You might want to read the man page on hotplug, and it might be necessary to
<TT>cp /etc/hotplug/usb.rc /etc/init.d/hotplug</TT> to get it fully working.  
</LI>
<LI>You can explicitly force the appropriate usb modules to be loaded by
   adding:

apcaccess
</H2>
<A NAME="1298"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-apcaccess-111"></A>apcaccess is a program (normally found in /sbin/apcaccess) that permits you to
print out the complete status of your UPS. Although there are a number of
command line arguments (<B>eprom, reconfig, status, slave, shutdown</B>), all
except <B>eprom</B> and <B>status</B> are under development and hence do not
work reliably.  

<P>
If you have built apcupsd with pthreads enabled (default), apcaccess will use
the Network Information Server to obtain the necessary information for the
<B>status</B> and <B>eeprom</B> commands. This is because in the pthreaded
version, there is no IPC shared memory. In this case (pthreads enabled), you
can specify a second optional argument to apcaccess in the form of host:port,
where the :port is optional. The default is <B>localhost:3551</B>. Please note
that in versions prior to 3.10.6, the default NIS port was 7000, so if you are
mixing versions, you will need to take a lot of care to ensure that all
components are using the same port.  

<P>
To enable the apcupsd Network Information Server, which is normally the
default, you set: 

<P>
<PRE>
     NETSERVER on
     NISPORT 3551
</PRE>
<P>
in your <B>apcupsd.conf</B> file.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000181100000000000000">

</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="index-apcaccess-status-112"></A><A NAME="index-status_002c-apcaccess-113"></A>As mentioned above, the full form of the command is: 

<P>
<PRE>
     apcaccess status localhost:3551
</PRE>
<P>
where only apcaccess status should normally be needed. localhost may be
replaced by any machine name, fully qualified domain name, or IP address,
which means that apcaccess can access any UPS on the network running the
Network Information Server.  

<P>
The <B>status</B> command line option of apcaccess will produce a full printout
of all the <B>STATUS</B> variables used by apcupsd. This can be very helpful
for checking the condition of your UPS and to know whether or not apcupsd is
properly connected to it. For a complete description of the variables and
their meanings, please read the Status Format (see 
<A HREF="#apcupsd-Status-Logging">apcupsd Status Logging</A>) section of
the Technical Reference.  

<P>
Please note that if you invoke apcaccess within the first 30 seconds of
launching apcupsd, you will likely get an error message such as: 

<P>
<PRE>
     APCACCESS FATAL ERROR in apcipc.c at line 325
     attach_shmarea: shared memory version mismatch
</PRE>
<P>
This is because apcupsd is still in the process of initializing the shared
memory segment used to communicate between the two processes. There is also a
small window of time after which the memory segment is properly initialized
but before the UPS has been completely polled. If you invoke apcaccess during
this period, you will get the STATUS output, but with many of the values zero.
The solution is to wait at least 30 seconds after starting apcupsd before
launching apcaccess.  

<P>
To invoke apcaccess, enter: 

<P>
<PRE>
     apcaccess status
</PRE>
<P>
For a SmartUPS 1000 apcaccess will emit the following output:

For example, you will not get MAXLINEV, MINLINEV, LINEFREQ, ... and in
particular, the LOADPCT will be zero when you are running on mains. LOADPCT
will display when the UPS is on batteries.  You must remember that the

Since apccontrol is a script, you can customize it to your own needs using any

counters BATTERYLEVEL and MINUTES.  As a consequence, apcupsd will shutdown on
the first limit that triggers (either an apcupsd limit, or a UPS limit). The
UPS internal counter equivalent to BATTERYLEVEL can be found in the hid-ups
report as RemainingCapacityLimit, which is typically factory set to 10
percent. In addition, the Low Battery signal is normally given by the UPS when
less than 2 minutes of run time remain.

and you should specify an installation directory with <TT><code>--</code>with-cgi-bin=</TT> or
load them manually. The default directory for installation of the CGI programs is
/etc/apcupsd, which is not really where you want them if you are going to use them.
Normally, they should go in the cgi-bin of your Web server.

<P>
Once built and loaded, they will give you the status of your UPS or UPSes over
the network.

Before using multimon and the other CGI programs, first ensure that apcupsd is
configured to run the Network Information Server. This is done by setting <B>NETSERVER on</B> in /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf.  This switch is on by default.  If
you are unsure of its state, see the section at the end of this chapter
concerning the Client test program.

Next you must edit the hosts file /etc/apcupsd/hosts.conf and at the end, add
the name of the hosts you want to monitor and a label string for them. Kern
Sibbald uses multimon.conf unmodified from what is on the source distribution.
However, he has modified the hosts.conf file to contain the following three

currently running apcupsd. Please note that the network names may either be IP
addresses or fully qualified domain names.  The network name (or IP address)
may optionally be followed by <B>:&lt;port&gt;</B>, where the port is the NIS
port address you wish to use. This is useful if you are running multiple
copies of apcupsd on the same system or if you are running in a mixed vendor
environment where the NIS port assignments differ. An example could be the
following: 

<P>
<PRE>
     MONITOR matou "Server"
     MONITOR polymatou "Backup server"
     MONITOR deuter  "Disk server"
     MONITOR polymatou:7001 "APC USB UPS"
</PRE>
<P>
where the USB copy of apcupsd has been configured to use port 7001 (with <TT><code>--</code>with-nis-port=7001</TT> on the <TT>./configure</TT> or by modifying apcupsd.conf).
Note, the default NIS port is 3551 on most platforms.  

<P>
To test multimon.cgi, you can execute it as non-root directly from the source
cgi build directory. To do so, enter at a shell prompt: 

<P>
<PRE>
     ./multimon.cgi

<P>
If everything is set up correctly, it will print a bunch of HTML with the
values of the machines that you have put in the hosts.conf file. It should
look something like the following (note, only a small portion of the output is
reproduced here):

If you do not get similar output, check the permissions of the /etc/apcupsd
directory and of those of /etc/apcupsd/hosts.conf to ensure that your web
server can access it. At many sites such as mine, the Apache server is not
running as root, so you must be careful to ensure that that
/etc/apcupsd/hosts.conf and /etc/apcupsd/multimon.conf are world readable.

Client Test Program:</A>
</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Client-Test-program-136"></A>When your Network Information Server is up and running, you can test it using
a simple program before attempting to access the server via your Web server.
The test program is called client.c and can be found in the examples
subdirectory of the source distribution. To build the program, when in the
examples directory, use something like the following: 

<P>
<PRE>
     cc client.c ../lib/libapc.a -o client
</PRE>
<P>
Then execute it: 

<P>
<PRE>
     ./client &lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;] [&lt;command&gt;]
</PRE>
<P>
Where <B>host</B> is the name of the host or the IP address of the host running
the Network Information Server. The default is the local host. You may
optionally specify a port address separated from the host name with a colon.
You may also optionally specify a single command to be executed. If you
specify a command, that command will be executed and the client program will
exit. This is a very simple and useful way of pulling the <B>status</B> or <B>events</B> data into another program such as Perl.  

<P>
If no error messages are printed, it has most likely established contact with
your server. Anything that you type as standard input will be passed to the
server, and anything the server sends back will be printed to standard output.
There are currently two commands recognized by the server: <B>events</B> and
<B>status</B>.  Hence the following commands: 

<P>
<PRE>
     ./client
     status
     events
     xyz
     ^D
</PRE>
<P>
should produce the status listing (the same as produced by <TT>apcaccess
status</TT>), followed by the list of the last 10 events (in response to the <B>events</B> command), and finally <B>Invalid command</B> in response to the <B>xyz</B> input, which is not a valid command. The control-D terminates the <B>client</B> program.  

<P>
The purpose of this program is to show you how to write your own program that
can determine the status of apcupsd and act any way you want (e.g. send you
email messages on certain events like line voltage boost, ...).

<LI>If you have <B>NETSERVER ON</B> in your apcupsd.conf file (which is the

   This may or may not pose a problem. If you don't consider this information
privileged, as is the case for me, there is little risk. In addition, if you
have a firewall between your servers and the Internet, crackers will not have
access to your UPS information.  Additionally, you can restrict who can access
your apcupsd server by using inted to run the sservice and using access
control lists with a TCP wrapper or by configuring TCP wrappers in apcupsd
(see below for TCP Wrapper details).  
</LI>
<LI>If you are running master/slave networking with a single UPS powering
   multiple machines, be aware that it is possible for someone to simulate the
   master and send a shutdown request to your slaves. The slaves do check that
the network address of the machine claiming to be the master is that same as
the address returned by DNS corresponding to the name of the master as
specified in your configuration file.

Configuring Your EEPROM

<P>
<A NAME="index-eeprom_002c-configuring-140"></A><A NAME="index-Configuring_002c-eeprom-141"></A>If you have a SmartUPS, there are depending on the UPS at least 12 different
values stored in the EEPROM that determine how the UPS reacts to various
conditions such as high line voltage, low line voltage, power down grace
periods, etc.  

<P>
In general, for the moment, we do not recommend that you change your EEPROM
values unless absolutely necessary. There have been several reported cases of
problems setting the Low Transfer Voltage. Consequently, if at all possible,
do not attempt to change this value.  

<P>
If despite these warnings, you must change your EEPROM, we recommend
connecting your UPS to a Windows or NT machine running PowerChute and making
the changes.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000187100000000000000">
apcupsd No Longer Configures EEPROM:</A>
</H3>

<P>
Unlike version 3.8.6, apcupsd version 3.10.x no longer has code to program the
EEPROM. Instead we have implemented interactive EEPROM modification code in
the apctest program. EEPROM programming must be done with apcupsd stopped so
that apctest can access the UPS. In addition, EEPROM programming is currently
implemented only for UPSes using the Smart protocol running in serial mode.
Perhaps at a later time when the appropriate kernel modifications are
standard, we will extend EEPROM programming to USB models.  

<P>
Before changing your EEPROM, you should make a printed copy of the current
state of your UPS before any EEPROM changes so that you can check the changes
that you have made. Do so by printing a copy of the output from <TT>apcaccess
status</TT> and also print a copy of the output from <TT>apcaccess eprom</TT>.  

<P>
Once this is done, choose which values of the EEPROM you want to change.
Typical output from apcaccess should look like the following:

appropriate value. You will shown the existing value and prompted for the new
values.  

<P>
We recommend that you change the EEPROM as little as is absolutely necessary
since it is a somewhat delicate process that has occasionally produced
problems (i.e. improper EEPROM values are displayed after the update).
Fortunately this seems to be quite rare and was much more likely to occur with
the old ``batch'' like process especially if incorrect values were supplied.

Below, you will find some suggestions for replacing batteries. One <I>important</I> note of caution: at least one user purchased one of the non-APC
batteries noted below and found out that they would not fit into his unit.
This required cutting and soldering and other very undesirable things, so be
extremely careful in measuring the batteries including every millimeter of the
terminal connections which can cause problems.  

<P>
Although you can do a hot swap of your batteries while the computer is
running, it may not be very satisfactory because the unit will not know that
the batteries have been swapped and apcupsd will continue to show Low Battery.
To correct this situation, you must do a discharge and recharge of the
battery followed by a battery recalibration using apctest.  At that point the
battery should be calibrated better.  As noted below, Carl has found that it
takes several discharge/charges before the runtime calibration is accurate. 
Take care not to discharge your battery too much as it tends to shorten the
battery life.

<BLOCKQUOTE>I thought I'd pass on some information I've obtained which you'll probably
eventually need. Besides, by writing it down I'll be able to find it the next
time. I started installing mine in 1995-1996. Lead-acid batteries have a
finite life even if not subjected to deep discharge cycles. For the batteries
used by APC, this is typically four to six years. As part of the self-test
cycle, the UPS measures the voltage of the battery at full charge (which falls
as the battery ages), and if it's below about 90% of the value for a new
battery, it sets off the ``Replace battery'' alarm, which it repeats every
day. [on apcupsd versions prior to 3.8.0, this message is sent once, on
version 3.8.0, it is sent every 9 hours - KES]. You will occasionally get a
false alarm. It's a good idea if you get an alarm to repeat the self-test the
next day and see if the alarm goes away. If the alarm is persistent, you need
to replace the batteries, which can be done without powering down the UPS or
load-you just open up the battery door, take out the old batteries, and hook
up the new ones.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>APC makes ``Replacement Battery Units'' for each of the SmartUPS models, but
they sell them directly only in the U.S.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It's best to wait until the low battery alarm before ordering a
replacement-keeping batteries on the shelf reduces their life unless you keep
them fully charged.

Finally, here is what Carl Erhorn has to say about batteries:  

<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hi, Folks.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, Kern was absolutely right. The problem with my UPS was batteries. It was
unexpected though, because there was no indication of a bad battery right up
until the UPS failed entirely.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For those who might encounter the same thing, and don't know what's happening
(I didn't either), here's what happened.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A week or so ago, I turned on one of my SmartUPS 700-NET models. The load is a
small dual P-III unix server (Solaris 8, X86) and a 4MM tape drive. During the
normal selftest that runs when you first turn on any APC UPS, the UPS 'freaked
out'. The alarm stuttered at about 4 or 5 beeps per second, and all the panel
lights flashed spasmodically, as if something was loose inside the UPS.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I turned off the UPS and it's load, then turned the UPS on again. This time,
everything seemed fine. I booted the system that was attached, and there were
no problems. The status monitor showed 9 minutes runtime (which indicates
fairly low capacity), but the batteries showed fully charged. I began to
suspect a bad inverter in the UPS.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, Kern told me that he suspected the batteries. So I took the UPS
offline, put an old SU-600 in it's place (just barely big enough to handle the
startup peaks - I get an 'overload' lamp lit for about 2 seconds during boot),
and checked out the batteries. They did indicate that they were near the end
of life, so I ordered a replacement set. Those came in on Friday, and after
the initial charge, a complete charge/discharge cycle to recalibrate the UPS,
and some testing, I put it back in service.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Surprise! (Or maybe not?) Kern was right - there is nothing wrong with the
inverter or the charging circuit, and the new cells fixed everything.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What confused me is that there was no 'replace battery' indication from the
UPS, even when it failed, plus a fair amount of runtime indicated with a full
charge. So if you see such behavior on one of your UPS models, it makes sense
to replace the batteries, even if there is no indication that the batteries
have failed yet.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the things I learned during this process is that the UPS internal
calibration will lose accuracy over the life of the battery. I always do a
recalibrate when I install new cells, but rarely do it after that, as it's
time-consuming, and you really can't use the system attached to the UPS while
doing it. Since my systems are almost constantly in use, it's a pain to
schedule a recal, and I tend to put it off. This time it bit me. I'd suggest
that folks do a recal at least once every six months. It will make your
runtime estimates much more accurate, and also allows you to keep track of the
state of your batteries.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For those who don't know how to do this, here's what you do. This proceedure
should not be confused with the 'Recalibrate' feature in the APC
PowerchutePlus software. They do not do the same thing.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&gt;From APC's web site:  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Perform a Runtime Calibration. This is a manual procedure and should not be
confused with the runtime calibration performed through PowerChute plus. The
batteries inside of the Smart-UPS are controlled by a microprocessor within
the UPS. Sometimes it is necessary to reset this microprocessor, especially
after the installation of new batteries. Stop the PowerChute plus software
from running and disconnect the serial cable. There must be at least a 30%
load attached to the UPS during this procedure, but the process will cause the
UPS to shut off and cut power to its outlets. Therefore, attach a non-critical
load to the UPS and then force the UPS on battery by disconnecting it from
utility power. Allow the unit to run on battery until it turns off completely.
Make sure a 30% load is present! Plug the UPS back into the wall outlet and
allow it to recharge (it will recharge more quickly turned off and with no
load present). Once the unit has recharged, the ``runtime remaining''
calculation should be more accurate. Remember that if the unit is an older
model, then the runtime will not improve significantly.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Background:  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An APC Smart-UPS has a microprocessor which calculates runtime primarily based
on the load attached to the UPS and on its battery capacity. On the right side
of the front display panel there is a vertical graph of five LEDs. Each LED is
an indication of battery charge in increments of twenty percent: 20, 40, 60,
80, 100% (bottom to top). For example, if the battery charge is 99%, then
only four of the five LEDs are illuminated.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To ensure that an operating system receives a graceful shutdown when using
PowerChute plus or a SmartSlot accessory, an alert is generated by the
Smart-UPS indicating that the UPS has reached a low battery condition. The
alert is audible (rapid beeping), visual (flashing battery LED or LEDs), and
readable through the graphical interface of PowerChute plus software (or a
native UPS shutdown program within a particular operating system.) In order to
calculate this ``low battery condition,'' all Smart-UPS products have a
preconfigured low battery signal warning time of two minutes (this is the
factory default setting). There are a total of four user-changeable settings:
2, 5, 7, or 10 minutes. If the low battery signal warning time is set for 2
minutes, then the alerts will activate simultaneously two minutes prior to
shutdown. Similarly, if the total runtime for a particular UPS is 30 minutes
with a low battery signal warning time set at 10 minutes, then the UPS will
run on battery for 20 minutes before the low battery alert begins.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Total runtime is primarily based on two factors, battery capacity and UPS
load. UPS load and runtime on battery are inversely proportional: as load
increases, battery runtime decreases and vice versa. When utility power is
lost, the UPS begins discharging the battery in order to support the attached
load. Once power returns, the Smart-UPS will automatically begin to recharge
its battery.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My comments on this proceedure:  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe this proceedure works for all APC models that calulate runtime, not
just the SmartUPS. It's important that you load the UPS to 30% of the UPS
capacity, as reported by apcupsd or another UPS monitor program. I've found
that normal house lamps of different wattages allow me to adjust the load to
almost exactly what I want, which is between 30% and 35% of the UPS
capacity. This is critical te getting an accurate reading (according to the
APC web documents). Always bring the UPS to 100% charge first, as indicated
by the front panel lamps, or your UPS monitoring software.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set the UPS shutdown time to 2 minutes, all other settings to nominal, and
disconnect the serial port cable from the UPS before running the
recalibration. If you leave a monitoring program running through the serial
port, it will turn the UPS off early, and you don't want to do that during a
recalibration run. When the run is complete, and the UPS turns off, you can
reattach the serial cable, and the normal loads, and recharge the batteries
normally. If you think you might have a power outage during the recharge time,
allow the UPS to recharge to 20% or so (indicated by the panel lamps) before
trying to use the computer system. This will allow the UPS to handle short
dropouts while it recharges. Of course, if you can leave the computer off
during the recharge time, the UPS will recharge much faster.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As an aside, when the batteries failed, my total runtime at 100% charge and
an idle state was 9 minutes, which is pretty bad. I replaced the batteries
with extended capacity cells, which add about 15% to the stock capacity. Now,
after two complete charge/ discharge cycles, 100% charge shows the available
runtime to be 42 minutes on the system when it's idle, and 33 minutes when the
system is very busy. The differences are due to the load of the computer, when
the disks are busy, and the cpus are not in a halted state (my system halts
the cpus when they are idle, to save power and lower heat, as do other OS like
Linux), when compared to an idle state. Apcupsd indicates the load is about
27% when idle, and as much as 37% when heavily loaded.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I've found that two charge/discharge cycles result in a more accurate
recalibration when installing new cells. It appears that some batteries need
to be put through a couple of complete cycles before they reach their full
capacity. I've also noticed that the full-charge voltage is different for each
battery until they have been through two cycles. On the initial charge of my
new batteries, the 100% charge voltage on the two cells was almost .5 VDC
apart. After two complete cycles, the batteries measure within .01 VDC of each
other!  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I hope this information helps anyone who might encounter the problem I saw,
and also shows folks how to recal their batteries. If you haven't done a
complete recalibration in a year or two, I'd recommend it, so that you have
warning of a low battery instead of what happened to me.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Hi, Folks.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I'm just replacing the batteries in one of my SmartUPS models, and it occurs
to me that some of you may not know about the place I get them from. I have no
relationship with this company, other than as a customer, but I feel they know
what they are doing, their prices are fair, and they have some interesting
batteries available that you can't obtain from APC.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These are the reasons I use them, and I thought this information might be
useful to the US list members. They will ship outside of the US. If you have
questions, you can contact them through the email address listed on their web
pages. They have always responded pretty quickly to my questions.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The company is called Battery Wholesale Distributors, and they are located in
Georgetown, Texas. If you have questions, you can reach them by phone at (800)
365-8444, 9:00AM to 5:00PM (their local time), Monday through Friday. I've
gotten email from them on the weekends, although the office is not open then. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I won't post prices, as you can get current pricing from their web site. They
have an entire section dedicated to APC replacement batteries, and it's easy
to find what you need. You can order over the web, or by phone. They accept
all the usual credit cards.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The web site (as you might guess) is: 
<A NAME="tex2html10"
  HREF="http://www.batterywholesale.com">www.batterywholesale.com</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The thing I really like is that they have found manufacturers who make
batteries in the standard case sizes, but have additional capacity over the
original batteries shipped with the APC UPS models. Often, the difference is
as much as 15% or so, and this can result in additional runtime. It's a nice
upgrade for a minor increase in price.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>They are also 'green-aware', in that they encourage you to recycle your old
batteries, and will accept the old batteries back from you if you cannot find
a local place that recycles them. You pay the shipping, but I think other than
that, there is no charge. I've never done this, as I have a battery retailer
just down the street who will accept my old batteries.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Anyway, if you didn't know about these folks, put the info aside where you can
find it when you need replacement batteries. I won't make any guarantees, but
I've been very pleased with their products, service, and pricing. I hope you
find them as helpful to you as I do. I've been dealing with them since about
1994, and have never been disappointed. The owner of the place also is very
good on technical issues, so if you have questions on their products, he can
get as technical as you need to go.

Why all the craziness with custom serial cables?  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1561"></A>
   It was nothing more nor less than a form of customer control. For a long time
APC wanted to keep other people from talking to its UPSes so it could lock out
potential competition for its PowerChute software.  Scrambling the leads on
its serial cables was a cheap way to accomplish this - in fact, they tended
to be wired so that if you tried a straight-through cable, opening a serial
link to the UPS would be interpreted as a shutdown command!  

<P>
(Hardware companies often think like this - they lock up interfaces by
instinct, cornering a small market rather than growing a bigger one.  It's
fundamentally stupid and self-defeating, but it's the kind of stupid that
tends to sound good at an executive meeting.)  

<P>
Fortunately, APC has lost a lot of this attitude since about 2000; nowadays
they even release technical information to the apcupsd maintainers.

   What UPS brands does apcupsd support?  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1565"></A>
   Currently apcupsd supports only APC UPSes. However, some companies such as
Hewlett Packard put their own brand name on APC manufactured UPSes. Thus even
if you do not have an APC branded UPS, it may work with apcupsd. You will need
to know the corresponding APC model number. apcupsd supports all the popular
APC models. See the installation and configurations sections of this document
for more details.

   Does apcupsd support Windows?  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1567"></A>
   With release 3.8.0, apcupsd now runs on Win95/98, WinMe, WinNT, and Win2000
machines. All features of the Unix versions of apcupsd are implemented. The
UPS EEPROM programming features of apcupsd have not been tested under Windows.
Version 3.8.0 does not support simple signaling UPSes (BackUPS, etc). Version
3.8.1 does support most simple signaling UPSes, but not all cables (due to
deficiencies in the Windows serial port API). Please note that we have had
reports that apcupsd does not work properly on the WinXP system. If you have
any information on this, please email us.  

<P>

   I don't have a cable, which one should I build?  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1569"></A>
   First you must know if you have an apcsmart UPS or a voltage-signalling UPS.
See the table of supported UPSes (see 
<A HREF="#type_005ftable">type_table</A>). If you have a apcsmart UPS,
we recommend building a Custom Smart (see 
<A HREF="#Smart_002dCustom-Cable-for-SmartUPSes">Smart-Custom Cable for
SmartUPSes</A>) cable. If you
have a voltage-signaling UPS, we recommend that you build a Custom Simple (see

<P>
<A HREF="#Voltage_002dSignalling-Cable-for-_0022dumb_0022-UPSes">Voltage-Signalling Cable for "dumb"
UPSes</A>)
cable.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1576"></A>
   How much CPU resources does apcupsd use?  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1577"></A>
   Depending on your CPU speed, you may see more or less of the CPU consumed by
apcupsd. On a 400MHz Unix system, the CPU usage should fall well below 0.1%.
On slower systems, the percentage will increase proportionally to the decrease
in the CPU speed. On a 400Mhz Win98 machine, the CPU usage will be on the
order of 0.5-1.0%. This is higher than for Unix systems. However, compared to
the 30% CPU usage by APC's PowerChute (the version on the CDROM shipped with
my UPS), apcupsd's 0.5-1.0% is very modest.  

<P>
If you configure apcupsd to run with pthreads (<TT><code>--</code>with-pthreads</TT> on the
<TT>./configure</TT> line), apcupsd will run considerably faster, otherwise said,
it will consume less of your CPU, and it will use approximately one third of
the memory. For example, Carl Erhorn reports that on his Solaris system,
``With the old 3-process version, we averaged about 4.8MB of total memory
used. With the new single process, we use only about 1.7MB! That's also a very
good improvement.''  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1580"></A>
   What language is apcupsd written in?  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>

   It is written entirely in C.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1582"></A>
   We are using apcupsd-3.8.1-1 in RedHat 6.2. The slave, when shutting down, is
reporting an error at line 436 of apcupsd.c. The error is initiated by <TT>apcupsd <code>--</code>killpower</TT>! What can we do to fix this, and is it critical?  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1584"></A>
   No, the error is not serious. Unfortunately, the documentation in the area of
master/slaves is not very detailed, and for that reason, your slave setup is
not totally correct as explained below.  

<P>
On master machines, we modify /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt to re-invoke apcupsd with
the <TT><code>--</code>killpower</TT> option (actually the script apccontrol is called). This
causes the UPS to send the codes to the UPS to make it power off.  

<P>
On slave machines, these modifications should not be made to the
/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt script since the slave has no connection to the UPS.  

<P>
To eliminate the problem, on all your slave machines, either restore the
original halt file, or simply delete all the lines containing ***apcupsd***,
which were inserted by the apcupsd installation process.

<DT><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1586"></A>
   To test apcupsd, I unplugged the UPS to simulate a power outage. After the
machine went into the shutdown process I plugged the UPS back into the
commercial power source. This caused the shutdown process to hang after the
daemon tried to shut-off the ups. Have you run into this problem, and if so do
you have a remedy?  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1587"></A>
   Normally, once the shutdown process has begun, we cannot stop it, though there
<I>is</I> some code that tries to do so, we don't consider it a very good idea
- how do you stop a shutdown that has killed off half of the daemons
running on your system? Most likely you will be left with an unusable system.
In addition, when apcupsd is re-executed in the halt script after the disks
are synced, it tries to shut off the UPS power, but the UPS will generally
refuse to do so if the AC power is on. Since we cannot be 100% sure whether
or not the UPS will shut off the power, we don't attempt to reboot the system
if we detect that the power is back as it might then get caught by a delayed
power off (at least for Smart UPSes).

<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1591"></A>
   We use standard Unix serial port read() and write() calls so once a connection
is made, we generally have few problems. However, there have been reports that
APC's SNMP Management Card can cause serial port problems. If you have such a
card, we suggest that you remove it and see if the problem goes away. It is
also possible that some other process such as a getty is reading the serial
port.

   When apcupsd starts, I get the following error: ``attach_shmarea: cannot get

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1593"></A>
   This problem and the problem of <B>cannot create shm area</B> are due to the
fact that the shared memory key that apcupsd wants to use is already in use.
This happens most frequently when there is an old zombie apcupsd process still
in the system.  The solution is to remove the old process.  You can often see
what is going on by doing a: <TT>ipcs</TT> command as root when apcupsd is not
running. If you see a segment with the key 0x10feed01, you can be sure there
is some old apcupsd process still using it. If you cannot kill the old
process, you can try using <TT>ipcrm</TT> (see the man pages).  Recent versions
of apcupsd starting with apcupsd-3.8.2Beta6 should no longer have this problem
as they will automatically try using a different key.

   The two most likely causes of your problem are:  1. You have the wrong serial
port device name in the apcupsd.conf file. 2. The device name is not defined
on your system. Suggestions for proceeding:For the first item, check what your
serial port device should be named. You might be able to find the name with
an:  

<P>
<PRE>
          ls /dev
</PRE>
<P>
Normally there will be hundreds or even thousands of names that print. If that
doesn't produce anything useful, you can try step 2.  Perhaps your device is
not defined. To get more information on your devices try man <TT>MAKEDEV</TT> or
<TT>find / -name MAKEDEV</TT>.  It is often located in <TT>/dev/MAKEDEV</TT>. 
Looking at the documentation may tell you what the correct name is, or at

   How do I ensure that the slaves shutdown before the master?  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1605"></A>
   There are several strategies for getting the slaves properly shutdown before
shutting down the master. The first is to make the master wait a period of
time for the slaves to shutdown before doing its own shutdown. Currently, the
master always waits 30 seconds before starting its own shutdown. If this is
insufficient, you can add additional time by putting an appropriate <B>sleep</B> shell command in the /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol file just before the
actual system shutdown command is executed (there are something like 3
places). The second strategy is to put a TIMEOUT value in the apcupsd.conf
file on the slave that is sufficiently short that you are sure that the slave
will shutdown before the master. If the shutdown is done with a poweroff, this
will also save power so that the master can stay up longer.

<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="1608"></A>
   You simply add whatever commands are necessary in the appropriate case
statements in /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol, which is a standard script file that is
called to actually do the shutdown. Alternatively, you can add your own script
file that will be called before doing the commands in apccontrol. Your script
file must have the same name as the appropriate case statement in apccontrol;
it must be executable; and it must be in the same directory as apccontrol.

   The most common error causing your problem is an incorrect serial port
specification on your DEVICE directive. It should be:  

<P>
<PRE>
          DEVICE /dev/com2
</PRE>
<P>
On WinNT machines, and probably Win2000 machines you MUST use /dev/com2 unless
you modify the behavior of the boot process to prevent Windows from probing
the port. This is documented in our manual for WinNT. Although I imagine it is
the same for Win2000, I am not sure.  

<P>
The second most common problem is bad placement of the files i.e. you did not
install them in c:&#92;apcupsd Unfortunately for the current
release, this path is ``hard coded'' into the binaries.  

<P>
The third most common problem is that you did not run the setup.bat script
after loading the files. This is necessary to install apcupsd as a service.  

<P>
If all the above fails, try starting apcupsd by hand inside a CYGWIN rxvt
window if you use an rxvt window rather than a DOS window, you will see many
more of the error messages.

When apcupsd detects anomalies from your UPS device, it will make some
decisions that usually result in one or more calls to the script located in
/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol. The <B>apccontrol</B> file is a shell script that acts
on the first argument that apcupsd passes to it. These actions are set up by
default to sane behavior for all psituations apcupsd is likely to detect from
the UPS. However, you can change the apccontrol behavior for every single
action.  

<P>
To customize, so create a file with the same name as the action, which is
passed as a command line argument. Put your script in the /etc/apcupsd
directory.  

<P>
These events are sent to the system log, optionally sent to the temporary
events file (/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events), and they also generate a call to
/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol which in turn will call any scripts you have placed in
the /etc/apcupsd directory.  

<P>
Normally, /etc/apcupsd/acpcontrol is called only by apcupsd. Consequently, you
should not invoke it directly.  However, it is important to understand how it
functions, and in some cases, you may want to change the messages that it
prints using <TT>wall</TT>. We recommend that you do so by writing your own
script to be invoked by <TT>apccontrol</TT> rather than by modifying apccontrol
directly. This makes it easier for you to upgrade to the next version of
apcupsd  

<P>
In other case, you may want to write your own shell scripts that will be
invoked by apccontrol. For example, when a power fail occurs, you may want to
send an email message to root. At present the arguments that apccontrol
recognizes are:  

<P>
When apcupsd detects an event, it calls the apccontrol script with four
arguments as:  

<P>
apccontrol &lt;event&gt; &lt;ups-name&gt; &lt;connected&gt;
&lt;powered&gt;  

<P>

apccontrol will first give control to your script.  If you want apccontrol to
continue with the default action, simply exit your script with an exit status
of zero.  If you do not want apccontrol to continue with the default action,
your script should exit with the special exit code of <B>99</B>.  However, in
this case, please be aware that you must ensure proper shutdown of your
machine if necessary.

Server/Slave Networking using NIS and the NET Driver:</A>
</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="index-NIS-networking-157"></A><A NAME="index-Net-driver-158"></A>It is also possible to implement a network of NIS server/slave apcupsds using
the new 3.10.x code and the <B>net</B> driver. This mode of NIS server/slave
networking is considerably different from the old method described at the
beginning of this chapter. In the old code, there is a lot of configuration on
both the master and slave side, and the master polls or sends info to the
slave. Using the <B>net</B> driver is much simpler. However, you should
carefully check that the NIS slave does a proper shutdown. In the master/slave
code, the master ensures the best it can that the slave is shutdown or
notified before it shuts down itself. On the other hand, using the net driver,
the NIS server knows nothing about the NIS slaves that may be listening and
thus takes no special precautions to ensure that the NIS slaves receive the
shutdown signal. Since the NIS slave reads the master's data once per second
there should be no shutdown problems, and our experience confirms this.  This
question can only be answered by carefully testing the shutdown.  

<P>
In this NIS server/slave mode, the NIS server is a standard stand alone
configuration except that it must have <B>NETSERVER on</B> in the configuration
file and have an <B>NISPORT nnn</B> defined. Thus any apcupsd running in this
mode then becomes the NIS server.  

<P>
The NIS slave then uses the net driver to connect to the server's NIS output.
In this mode, the NIS slave decides how often to poll the server for the NIS
information. The NIS slave's conf file has <B>UPSTYPE net</B>, which will
invoke the ``network'' driver. By setting this machine's <B>DEVICE</B> to be
<B>server-ip:server-NIS-port</B> it will automatically connect to the NIS
server and use the server's signals to shutdown the computer.  In the example
net slave configuration file below, the slave uses the NIS information
provided by the computer <B>tibs</B> on port <B>3551</B>.

<A NAME="index-Problems_002c-Master_002fSlave-159"></A><A NAME="index-Problems_002c-networking-160"></A>When working with a master/slave or server/slave configurations (one UPS
powering more than one computer), the master/server and slave communicate via
the network. In many configurations, apcupsd is started before the network is
initialized. In this case, it is possible that the master will be unable to
contact the slave. On apcupsd versions prior to 3.8.0, this could cause
apcupsd to error off. The solution to this problem is to either force apcupsd
to be started after the network and the DNS (fiddle the symbolic links in
/etc/rc.d), or put the names of the slave machines in your /etc/hosts file, or
even more preferable, use IP addresses rather than machine names. On some
configurations, you may need to use fully qualified names (host.domain.xxx)
rather than simple host names.

To contact the slave, the slave name given in the configuration file must be
resolved to an IP address. In this case, apcupsd could not get the IP address.
Either the slave name is incorrect, your DNS may not be working, or you have
started apcupsd during the boot process before the network is operational.

This message occurs when the master attempts to send a message to the slave
SSS and gets an error. It indicates that either the slave machine is not

down. 

<P>

This message indicates that the master attempted to read the code key from the
slave SSS and it did not match the value expected. A common cause of this
problem is that the master and slave versions of apcupsd are not the same.
Please be sure you are running the same version of apcupsd on all your master

This message is logged when the master attempts to connect to slave SSS and no
connection is accepted. The most common cause of this problem is that the
slave copy of apcuspd is not yet ready to accept connections or is not
running. Generally, apcupsd will retry the connection a bit later. If the
problem is persistent, it can indicate a network problem or the slave name on
the SLAVE directive of the master's configuration file is incorrect.

This message is logged when the slave attempts to resolve the name given on
the MASTER configuration directive to an IP address. It probably means that
the master name MMM is not defined, your DNS is not properly working, or you
have started apcupsd in the boot process before the network is initialized.
Check the name MMM, or use an explicit IP address on the MASTER configuration
directive in the slave's configuration file.

   <A NAME="1847"></A>
   <A NAME="1850"></A>
This means that the slave has attempted to bind the port number so that it can
listen for messages from the master. This can occur if already have a copy of
apcupsd running, or you have previously run apcupsd in the past 5 or 10
minutes, because occasionally the operating system will not shutdown a port
correctly for 5 to 10 minutes after a program exits. In this case, you can
either wait a few minutes for the problem to go away, or use a different port
in both your master and slave configuration files.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000251100000000000000">
The First Copy of apcupsd:</A>
</H3>

<P>
For example, assuming you have SmartUPSes in both cases, to configure and
install the first copy of apcupsd, which controls a UPS and Computer A, one
could use the following configuration: 

<P>
<PRE>
     ./configure \
       --prefix=/usr \
       --sbindir=/sbin \
       --with-cgi-bin=/home/http/cgi-bin \

       --enable-pthreads \
       --with-nis-port=3551 \
       --enable-powerflute
</PRE>
<P>
This is pretty much a ``normal'' installation using many of the defaults. Once
built and installed, this would control the first UPS and cause a shutdown of
the system when the batteries are low.  This copy of apcupsd will be started
and stopped automatically when the system is booted and halted.

The Second Copy of apcupsd:</A>
</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Two-apcupsds-161"></A>To configure and install the second copy of apcupsd, which controls the second
UPS and Computer B, you could use the following configuration: 

<P>
<PRE>
     ./configure \
       --prefix=$HOME/apcupsd/bin \
       --sbindir=$HOME/apcupsd/bin \

Note, in this case, we use considerably more configuration options to ensure

different NIS (Network Information Server) port. And finally, we have used the

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000251300000000000000">
Important Steps after Installation of the Second Copy:</A>
</H3>

<P>
After the <TT>make install</TT> of the second copy of apcupsd there are a number
important steps to complete. You must either remove or modify the file
$HOME/apcupsd/bin/apccontrol, so that it will not shutdown Computer A when
the battery of UPS 2 is low. One suggestion is to copy
examples/safe.apccontrol into $HOME/apcupsd/bin/apccontrol. Alternatively,
you could edit the $HOME/apcupsd/bin/apccontrol and delete all statements
that attempt to shutdown the machine. Another important step is to find a way
to shutdown Computer B when UPS 2's battery is low.  Probably the simplest way
to do this is to edit $HOME/apcupsd/bin/apcupsd.conf on Computer A so that
this second copy of apcupsd becomes a network master. Then install a standard
slave configuration on Computer B. Please remember that if UPS 1's batteries
are exhausted before UPS 2's batteries, Computer B may not be properly
shutdown. And at the current time, there is no simple means to make the two
copies of apcupsd running on Computer A communicate. Thus there are certain
risks in such a configuration. However, these configurations can be very
useful for powering electronic equipment and such.  

<P>
If Computer B is vitally important, it would probably be better to purchase a
serial port card for it, or perhaps use a USB UPS. To ensure that it is
properly shutdown if Computer A goes down, you could run a second copy of
apcupsd on Computer B as a slave connected to the main copy of apcupsd on
Computer A. Thus Computer B would be running two slaves, one driven by the
master controlling UPS 1 and the other by the master controlling UPS 2, and
Computer B could be shutdown by the first master that signaled it to do so.

SNMP Trap Catching
</H2>
<A NAME="1960"></A>

<P>
apcupsd-3.11.14 introduces support for SNMP trap catching with the APC
PowerNet MIB driver. Previous versions polled the UPS status once per minute, 
leading to significany delays before UPS state changes were recognized. With 
SNMP trap handling, apcupsd monitors the SNMP trap port and will re-poll the
UPS whenever a trap is received. This happens, for example, when the UPS 
switches on or off battery.

<P>
In order for this feature to work, you must configure your UPS to
deliver traps to the server running apcupsd. This is generally done by 
connecting to your SNMP card via a web browser or telnet connection. You
will need to enter your server's IP address as a trap receiver and make sure
trap delivery is enabled.

<P>
Trap catching can lead to problems if you are already running another SNMP
trap daemon on your server. Only one daemon can listen to the trap port, so
whichever one is started first will succeed and the others will fail. Apcupsd
will fall back to polling behavior if it is unable to open the trap port. You
can also forcibly disable trap catching by setting your vendor string in the
<B>apcupsd.conf</B> <B>DEVICE</B> directive to "APC_NOTRAP".

<A NAME="1969"></A>

<P>
Currently (as of 3.10.0) the code to power off the UPS needs special
configuration. The killpower command for SNMP UPSes can not be issued during
shutdown as typically at some time during shutdown operations the network
stack is stopped. To overcome this problem it is needed to modify the
/etc/rc.d/apcupsd system control script to tell apcupsd to issue the power
down command (killpower) to the UPS immediately before apcupsd initiates the
system shutdown. For this reason it is paramount to set your UPS grace time to
a value greater than 120 seconds to allow for clean shutdown operations before
the UPS removes the power from its plugs. To enable correct shutdown operation
during powerdown do the following:  

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Connect to your Web/SNMP card using your favorite web browser, go to the
   UPS configuration menu and change the ``Shutdown Delay'' parameter to 180
   seconds or more, depending on how much time your system shutdown requires to

Alternate Ways To Run The Network Information Server
</H1>
<A NAME="1979"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-NIS-alternate-was-of-running-165"></A>apcupsd maintains STATUS and EVENTS data concerning the UPS and its operation.
This information can be obtained over the network using either apcnisd or
apcupsd's internal network information server, which is essentially the same
code as apcnisd but compiled into apcupsd. Clients on the network make a
connection to the information server and send requests for status or events
data, which the server then transmits to them.  

<P>
The information served to the network by this interface should not be confused
with master/slave mode that shares a UPS between two or more computers. That
code is described in 
<A HREF="#Configuration-Directives-for-Sharing-a-UPS">Configuration Directives for Sharing a
UPS</A> of this
documentation.  

<P>
There are three different ways to run the information server depending on your
requirements and preferences. It can be run as 1.  a standalone program, 2. a
standalone program invoked by the inetd daemon, or 3. as a thread (or child
process) of apcupsd (default configuration). We recommend option 3 unless you
have specific reasons to do otherwise. Option 3 is what is configured in by
default.

<A NAME="1985"></A>
<BR>
Running the server as a child of apcupsd
</H2>
<A NAME="1988"></A>

<P>
This is probably the simplest way to run the network information server. To do
so, you simply make sure the <B>NETSERVER</B> directive in
/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf is <B>on</B>, and then stop and restart apcupsd. It
will automatically create the server thread (or spawn an additional child
process named apcnis) to handle network clients. In the case where pthreads
are enabled, a new thread will be created rather than a child process to
handle the network information requests. Note, the above modification should
not be necessary if you use the default apcupsd.conf, since it is already
turned on.  

<P>
Although this method is simple, it affords no protection from the outside
world accessing your network server unless you are behind a firewall. In
addition, if there is a bug in the network server code, or if a malicious user
sends bad data, it may be possible for apcnis to die, in which case, though it
is not supposed to, apcupsd may also exit, thus leaving your machine without
shutdown protection. In addition, since apcupsd is running at root level, all
threads or any child process will do so also. That being said, most of us
prefer to run the server this way.  

<P>
With apcupsd version 3.8.2 and later, you may enable the TCP Libwrap
subroutines to add additional security. In this case, access to the network
server will be controlled by the statements you put in /etc/hosts.allow.

Running apcnisd from INETD
</H2>
<A NAME="1997"></A>

<P>
This is probably the most secure and most desirable way of running the network
information server. Unfortunately, it is a bit more complicated to set up.
However, once running, the server remains unexecuted until a connection is
attempted, at which point, inetd will invoke apcnisd. Once apcnisd has
responded to the client's requests, it will exit. None of the disadvantages of
running it standalone apply since apcnisd runs only when a client is
requesting data. Note, running in this manner works only if you are using the
old forking code and have pthreads explicitly turned off. The pthreads version
of apcupsd does not support the shared memory calls that are necessary for
apcnisd to access the internal state of apcupsd.  

<P>
An additional advantage of this method of running the network information
server is that you can call it with a TCP wrapper and thus use access control
lists (ACL) such as hosts.allow. See the man pages for hosts.allow for more
details.  

<P>
To configure apcnisd to run from INETD, you must first put an entry in
/etc/services as follows: 

<P>
<PRE>
     apcnisd         3551/tcp
</PRE>
<P>
This defines the port number (3551) and the service (TCP) that apcnisd will be
using. This statement can go anywhere in the services file. Normally, one adds
local changes such as these to the end of the file.  

<P>
Next, you must modify /etc/inetd.conf to have the following line: 

<P>
<PRE>
     apcnisd stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /sbin/apcnisd -i
</PRE>
<P>
If you do not want to run the TCP wrapper, then the line should be entered as
follows (not tested): 

<P>
<PRE>
     apcnisd stream  tcp     nowait  root    /sbin/apcnisd -i
</PRE>
<P>
Please check that the file locations are correct for your system. Also, note
that the <TT>-i</TT> option is necessary so that apcnisd knows that it was called
by INETD. Before restarting INETD, first ensure that the <B>NETSERVER</B>
directive in /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf is set to <B>off</B>. This is necessary
to prevent apcupsd from starting a child process that acts as a server. If you
change <B>NETSERVER</B>, you must stop and restart apcupsd for the
configuration change to be effective.  

<P>
Finally, you must restart INETD for it to listen on port 3551. On a Red Hat
system, you can do so by: 

<P>
<PRE>
     /etc/rc.d/init.d/inet reload
</PRE>
<P>
At this point, when a client attempts to make a connection on port 3551, INETD
will automatically invoke apcnisd.

Running apcnisd Standalome
</H2>
<A NAME="2016"></A>

<P>
This is probably the least desirable of the three ways to run an apcupsd
network information server because if apcupsd is stopped, you must also stop
apcnisd before you can restart apcupsd. This is because apcnisd, when run
standalone, holds the shared memory buffer by which apcnisd and apcupsd
communicate. This prevents a new execution of apcupsd from creating it.  

<P>
To execute apcnisd in standalone mode, first ensure that the <B>NETSERVER</B>
directive in <B>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</B> is set to <B>off</B>. This is
necessary to prevent apcupsd from starting a child process that acts as a
server. Restart apcupsd normally, then: 

<P>
<PRE>
     /sbin/apcnisd
</PRE>
<P>
The advantage of running the network information server standalone is that if
for some reason, a client causes the network server to crash, it will not
affect the operation of apcupsd.

<A NAME="index-Developers-Notes-169"></A>All logging functions and all error reporting are now done through the
log_event() subroutine call. Exceptions to this are: initialization code
where printf's are done, and writing to the status file. Once the
initialization code has completed and the fork() to become a daemon is done,
no printf's are used. log_event() has exactly the same format as syslog(). In
fact, the subroutine consists of only a syslog() call. If anyone really wishes
to log to a file, the code to do so can easily be done by adding code to
log_event() in apclog.c.

The Windows Version of apcupsd
</H1>
<A NAME="2095"></A>

<P>
The Windows version of apcupsd has been tested on Win95, Win98, WinMe, WinNT,
WinXP, and Win2000 systems. This version of apcupsd has been built to run
under the CYGWIN environment, which provides many of the features of Unix on
Windows systems. It also permitted a rapid port with very few source code
changes, which means that the Windows version is for the most part running
code that has long proved stable on Unix systems. Even though the Win32
version of apcupsd is a port that relies on many Unix features, it is just the
same a true Windows program. When running, it is perfectly integrated with
Windows and displays its icon in the system icon tray, and provides a system
tray menu to obtain additional information on how apcupsd is running (status
and events dialogue boxes). If so desired, it can also be stopped by using the
system tray menu, though this should normally never be necessary.  

<P>
Once installed apcupsd normally runs as a system service.  This means that it
is immediately started by the operating system when the system is booted, and
runs in the background even if there is no user logged into the system.

<P>
If you wish to install the package elsewhere, please note that you will need
to proceed with a manual installation, which is not particularly easy as you
must rebuild the source and change the configuration file as well.  

<P>
This installation assumes that you do <B>not</B> have CYGWIN installed on your
computer. If you do, and you use mount points, you may need to do a special
manual installation.  

<P>
Once you have unzipped the binaries, open a window pointing to the binary
installation folder (normally c:&#92;apcupsd). This folder should
contain folders with the name bin, etc, examples, and manual. If and when you
no longer need them, the examples and manual sub-folders of the
c:&#92;apcupsd directory may be removed.  

<P>
Continuing the installation process:

<UL>
<LI>Open the directory
   c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;etc&#92;apcupsd in the
   Windows Explorer by Clicking on the apcupsd folder then on the etc folder,
then on the apcupsd folder. Finally double click on the file apcupsd.conf and
edit it to contain the values appropriate for your site. In most cases, no
changes will be needed, but if you are not using COM1 for your serial port,
you will need to set the <B>DEVICE</B> configuration directive to the correct
serial port. Note, if you are using WinNT or Win2000, the operating system may
probe the port attempting to attach a serial mouse. This will cause apcupsd to
be unable to communicate with the serial port. If this happens, or out of
precaution, you can edit the c:&#92;boot.ini file. Find the line
that looks something like the following:  

<P>
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)&#92;WINNT=``Windows NT
Workstation Version 4.00''  

<P>
and add the following to the end of the line: /NoSerialMice:COM1 (or COM2
depending on what you want to use). The new line should look similar to:  

<P>
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)&#92;WINNT=``Windows NT
Workstation Version 4.00'' /NoSerialMice:COM1  

<P>
where the only thing you have changed is to append to the end of the line.
This addition will prevent the operating system from interferring with apcupsd

   that you see its contents.  
</LI>
<LI>To do the final step of installation, double click on the setup.bat

<P>
<A NAME="index-Windows_002c-Installation-Directory-172"></A>The Win32 version of apcupsd must reside in the
c:&#92;apcupsd&#92; directory, and there must be a
c:&#92;tmp directory on your machine. The installation will do this
automatically, and we recommend that you do not attempt to place apcupsd in
another directory. If you do so, you are on your own, and you will need to do
a rebuild of the source.

<A NAME="index-Windows_002c-Testing-173"></A><A NAME="index-Testing_002c-Windows-174"></A>It would be hard to overemphasize the need to do a full testing of your

properly in a real power failure situation.  

<P>
Please read 
<A HREF="#Testing-Apcupsd">Testing Apcupsd</A> of this document for
general instructions on testing the Win32 version. However, on Win32 systems,
there is no Unix system log file, so if something goes wrong, look in the file
c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;etc&#92;apcupsd&#92;
apcupsd.events where apcupsd normally logs its events, and you will
generally find more detailed information on why the program is not working.
The most common cause of problems is either improper configuration of the
cable type, or an incorrect address for the serial port.

<P>
<A NAME="index-Windows_002c-Upgrading-175"></A><A NAME="index-Upgrading-Windows-176"></A>On Win98 and Win95 systems, to upgrade to a new release, simply stop apcupsd
by using the tray icon and selecting the <B>Close apcupsd</B> menu item, or by
double clicking on the <B>Stop</B> icon located in the
c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;bin directory, then apply the upgrade
and restart apcupsd.  

<P>
On WinNT systems (and Win2000 systems), you may stop apcupsd as indicated
abover or alternatively you may stop apcupsd by using the <B>Services</B> item
in the <B>Control Panel</B>. In addition, at least on my system, there seems to
be a WinNT bug that causes the system to prevent <B>apcupsd.exe</B> from being
overwritten even though the file is no longer being used.  This is manifested
by an error message when attempting load a new version and overwrite the old
apcupsd.exe (the extract part of WinZip as described above). To circumvent
this problem (if it happens to you), after shutting down the running version
of apcupsd, through the <B>Services</B> dialogue in the <B>Control Panel</B>,
first click on the <B>Stop button</B>:

After closing the dialogues, reboot the system, typical of Microsoft :-(. When
the system comes back up, apcupsd will not be automatically launched as a
service, and you can install the new version. To reinstate apcupsd as an
automatic service, using the <B>Control Panel</B>: reset apcupsd to <B>Automatic</B> startup in the Startup dialogue, then restart apcupsd in the <B>Services</B> dialogue as shown above in the installation instructions. Frequently
after an upgrade, you will click on the <B>Start</B> button and after a few
seconds, the system reports that it failed to start. The cause of this problem
is unknown, but the solution is simply to click again on the <B>Start</B>

Post Installation
</H2>
<A NAME="2250"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Windows_002c-Post-Installation-177"></A>After installing apcupsd and before running it, you should check the contents
of two files to ensure that it is configured properly for your system. The
first is
c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;etc&#92;apcupsd&#92;
apcupsd.conf. You will probably need to change your UPSCABLE directive, your
UPSTYPE and possibly your DEVICE directives. Please refer to the configuration
section of this manual for more details.  

<P>
The second file that you should examine is
c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;etc&#92;apcupsd&#92;
apccontrol. This file is called by apcupsd when events (power loss, etc) are
generated. It permits the user to program handling the event. In particular,
it permits the user to be notified of the events. For the Win32 version, each
event is programmed to display a Windows popup dialogue box. If your machine
is mostly unattended, you may want to comment out some of these popup dialogue
boxes by putting a pound sign (#) in column one of the appropriate line.

<P>
<A NAME="index-Problems_002c-Windows-178"></A><A NAME="index-Windows_002c-Problems-179"></A>In addition to possible problems of reinstallation or upgrade on WinNT
systems, as noted above, we have discovered the following problem: On some
Windows systems, the domain resolution does not seem to work if you have not
configured a DNS server in the Network section of the Control Panel. This
problem should be apparent only when running a master or a slave
configuration. In this case, when you specify the name of the master or the
slave machine(s) in your apcupsd.conf file, apcupsd will be unable to resolve
the name to a valid IP address. To circumvent this problem, simply enter all
machine addresses as an IP address rather than a domain name, or
alternatively, ensure that you have a valid DNS server configured on your
system (often not the case on Win32 systems).  For example, instead of using
the directive ``MASTER my.master.com'' use something like ``MASTER
192.168.1.54'' where you replace the IP address with your actual IP address.  

<P>
Also, on WinNT systems, the PIF files in /apcupsd/bin used for starting and
stopping apcupsd do not work. Use the services control panel instead.  

<P>
On Win95 systems, there are reports that the PIF files do not work. If you
find that to be the case, the simplest solution is to use the batch files that
we have supplied in the c:/apcupsd/bin directory. Also, on Win95 systems, we
have an unconfirmed report that indicates that apcupsd does not start
automatically as a service even though the Registry has been properly updated.
If you experience this problem, a work around is to put a shortcut to apcupsd
in the StartUp folder.  

<P>
As noted above, after an upgrade, you may need to start apcupsd several times
before it will actually run.  

<P>
On WinNT, WinXP, and Win2K systems, you can examine the System Applications
log to which apcupsd writes Windows error messages during startup.  

<P>
Regardless of which Windows system you are running, apcupsd logs most error
messages to
c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;etc&#92;apcupsd&#92;
apcupsd.events. This type error messages such as configuration file not
found, etc are written to this file.

<P>
The directory c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;bin contains six

     Install
     Uninstall
     ups-events
     ups-status
</PRE>
<P>
Any of these utilities may be used on any system, with the exception of the
Start utility, which cannot be used on WinNT and Win2000 systems. On those
systems, the apcupsd service must always be started through the <B>Services</B>
sub-dialogue of the <B>Control Panel</B>.  

<P>
The <B>Install</B> and <B>Uninstall</B> utilities install and uninstall apcupsd
from the system registry only. All other pieces (files) of apcupsd remain
intact. It is not absolutely necessary for apcupsd to be installed in the
registry as it can run as a regular program. However, if it is not installed
in the registry, it cannot be run as a service.  

<P>
The functions of <B>Stop</B>, <B>ups-events</B>, and <B>ups-status</B> can be
more easily invoked by right clicking on the apcupsd icon in the system tray
and selecting the desired function from the popup menu.

<P>
<A NAME="index-Disclaimer-180"></A>Some of the features such as EEPROM programming have not been exhaustively
tested on Win32 systems. If at all possible, we recommend not to use it as a
network master on Win95, Win98, and WinMe due to the instability of those
operating systems.  

<P>
Some items to note:  

<P>

<UL>
<LI>This version of apcupsd will not attempt to shut off the UPS power when
   the battery is exhausted. Thus if the power returns before the UPS completely
   shuts down, your computer may not reboot automatically. This is because we do
not know how to regain control after the disks have been synced in order to
shut off the UPS power.  

<P>
Nevertheless, it is possible to use the <TT><code>--</code>kill-on-powerfail</TT> option on
the apcupsd command line, but the use of this option could cause the power to
be cut off while your machine is still running. See 
<A HREF="#Shutdown-Sequence-_003c1_003e">Shutdown Sequence</A> of this
document for a more complete discussion of this subject. If you are still
interested in trying to get this to work, please look at the code that is
commented out in
c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;etc&#92;apcupsd&#92;
apccontrol under the <B>doshutdown</B> case.  

<P>
An alternative to the <TT><code>--</code>kill-on-powerfail</TT> option is to use the KILLDELAY
(see 
<A HREF="#KILLDELAY-_003ctime-in-seconds_003e">KILLDELAY &lt;time in
seconds&gt;</A>) configuration
directive.  

<P>
This configuration directive is appropriate on Windows machines where apcupsd
continues to run even when the machine is halted (as is the case on most NT
machines).  
</LI>
<LI>When apcupsd detects important events, it calls
   c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;etc&#92;apcupsd&#92;
   apccontrol, which is a Unix shell script. You may modify this script to suit
your particular needs.  Currently, it puts a Windows dialogue on the screen
with a brief explanation of the event. If these dialogues annoy you, you can
remove or comment out the calls to <B>popup</B> from this file.

<A NAME="2323"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Email-181"></A><A NAME="index-Notification_002c-Email-182"></A>On Win95/98 systems, it is possible to receive notification of apcupsd events
that are passed to apccontrol. This is possible using a simple email program
that unfortunately is not functioning 100% correctly. In addition, I (Kern)
was not able to make this program work on WinNT while apcupsd is running as a
service under the system account (it works fine with any user account).  

<P>
If you wish to try this program on Win95/98 systems, look at the files named
<B>changeme, commfailure, commok, onbattery, and mainsback</B> in the directory
c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;examples. To use them, you must
modify the SYSADMIN variable to have a valid email address, then copy the
files into the directory
c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;etc&#92;apcupsd.

Killpower under Windows
</H2>
<A NAME="2338"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Windows_002c-Killpower-183"></A>If your batteries become exhausted during a power failure and you want your
machine to automatically reboot when the power comes back, it is useful to
implement the killpower feature of the UPS where apcupsd sends the UPS the
command to shut off the power.  In doing so, the power will be cut to your PC
and if your BIOS is properly setup, the machine will automatically reboot when
the power comes back. This is important for servers.  

<P>
This feature is implemented on Unix systems by first requesting a system
shutdown. As a part of the shutdown, apcupsd is terminated by the system, but
the shutdown process executes a script where apcupsd is recalled after the
disks are synced and the machine is idle. Apcupsd then requests the UPS to
shut off the power (killpower).  

<P>
Unfortunately on Windows, there is no such shutdown script that we are aware
of and no way for apcupsd to get control after the machine is idled. If this
feature is important to you, it is possible to do it by telling apcupsd to
immediately issue the killpower command after issuing the shutdown request.
The danger in doing so is that if the machine is not sufficiently idled when
the killpower takes place, the disks will need to be rescanned (and there is a
possibility of lost data however small). Generally, UPSes have a shutdown
grace period which gives sufficient time for the OS to shutdown before the
power is cut.  

<P>
To implement this feature, you need to add the <TT>-p</TT> option to the apcupsd
command line that is executed by the system.  Currently the procedure is
manual. You do so by editing the registry and changing the line: 

<P>
<PRE>
     c:\apcupsd\apcupsd.exe /service
</PRE>
<P>
found under the key: 

<P>
<PRE>
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
</PRE>
<P>
to 

<P>
<PRE>
     c:\apcupsd\apcupsd.exe /service -p
</PRE>
<P>
If you have a Smart UPS, you can configure the kill power grace period, and
you might want to set it to 3 minutes. If you have a dumb UPS, there is no
grace period and you should not use this procedure. If you have a Back-UPS CS
or ES, these UPSes generally have a fixed grace period of 2 minutes, which is
probably sufficient.

<P>
<A NAME="index-Windows_002c-Power-down-184"></A><A NAME="index-Power-down_002c-Windows-185"></A>Our philosophy is to shutdown a computer but not to power it down itself (as
opposed to having the UPS cut the power as described above). That is we prefer
to idle a computer but leave it running. This has the advantage that in a
power fail situation, if the killpower function described above does not work,
the computer will continue to draw down the batteries and the UPS will
hopefully shutoff before the power is restore thus permitting an automatic
reboot.  

<P>
Nevertheless some people prefer to do a full power down. To do so, you might
want to get a copy of PsShutdown, which does have a power down option. You can
find it and a lot more useful software at: 
<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pstools.shtml">http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pstools.shtml</A>. to use their shutdown program
rather than the apcupsd supplied version, you simply edit: 

<P>

     c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apccontrol

with any text editor and change our calls to shutdown to psshutdown.

before you can even think about configuring the software. First, you need to
figure out whether it's a dumb (voltage-signalling) UPS or speaks the apcsmart
protocol (see this discussion (see 
<A HREF="#upstypes">upstypes</A>)).  Second, if you have an interface
cable from APC, you need to figure out what kind it is.  If you don't have
such a cable, you need to build one.  A straight-through serial cable won't
work (see 
<A HREF="#crazy">crazy</A>).

According to Bill Marr the Belkin F5U109, also sold as F5U409 also works with
apcupsd for kernel versions 2.4.25 or higher and kernels 2.6.1 and higher. 
These newer kernels are needed to have the patch that makes the mct_u232

<A NAME="2417"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Serial-on-USB-190"></A>By using a special adaptor, you can connect your serial-line UPS to a USB
port. If you would like to free up your serial port and connect your existing
serial port UPS to a USB port, it is possible if you have one of the later
kernels. You simply get a serial to USB adapter that is supported by the
kernel, plug it in and make one minor change to your apcupsd.conf file and
away you go. (Kern adds: Thanks to Joe Acosta for pointing this out to me.)  

<P>
The device that Joe Acosta and Kern are using is IOgear GUC232A USB 2 serial
adapter. Bill Marr informs us that it also works with a Back-UPS Pro 650 and
the 940-0095B cable.  

<P>
At Kern's site, running Red Hat 7.1 with kernel 2.4.9-12, he simply changed
his /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf configuration line to be:

<P>
Depending on whether or not you have <B>hotplug</B> working, you may need to
explicitly load the kernel modules <B>usbserial</B> and <B>pl2303</B>. In Kern's

An interesting fact is that the USB ports (actually an RJ45 connector) on APC
UPSes not only speak USB, but also serial apcsmart and dumb voltage-signalling
as well! This is something that one of our users discovered by accident. With
the Custom RJ45 cable (actually a RJ45 to serial cable) described below
plugged into the APC UPS USB socket at one end and the other end plugged into
a serial port on your PC, any APC USB UPS (except some of the newer really low

If you already have an APC cable, you can determine what kind it is by
examining the flat sides of the two connectors where you will find the cable
number embossed into the plastic. It is generally on one side of the male
connector.

To make your own cable you must first know whether you have a UPS that speaks
the apcsmart protocol or a ``dumb'' UPS that uses serial port line voltage
signalling.

If you have an apcmart UPS, and you build your own cable, build a <I>Smart-Custom</I> cable. If you have a voltage-Signalling or dumb UPS, build a
<I>Simple-Custom</I> cable. If you have a BackUPS CS with a RJ45 connector, you
can build your own <I>Custom-RJ45</I> cable.

<P>
<A NAME="index-Cables_002c-Smart-Signalling-194"></A><A NAME="index-Cables_002c-BackUPS-CS-195"></A>If you have a BackUPS CS, you are probably either using it with the USB cable
that is supplied or with the 940-0128A supplied by APC, which permits running
the UPS in dumb mode. By building your own cable, you can now run the BackUPS
CS models (and perhaps also the ES models) using smart signalling and have all
the same information that is available as running it in USB mode.  

<P>
The jack in the UPS is actually a 10 pin RJ45. However, you can just as easily
use a 8 pin RJ45 connector, which is more standard (ethernet TX, and ISDN
connector). It is easy to construct the cable by cutting off one end of a
standard RJ45-8 ethernet cable and wiring the other end (three wires) into a
standard DB9F female serial port connector.  

<P>
Below, you will find a diagram for the CUSTOM-RJ45 cable:

<P>
For the serial port DB9F connector, the pin numbers are stamped in the plastic
near each pin. In addition, there is a diagram near the end of this chapter.  

<P>
Note, one user, Martin, has found that if the shield is not connected to the
Frame Ground in the above diagram (not in our original schematic), the UPS (a
BackUPS CS 500 EI) will be unstable and likely to rapidly switch from power to
batteries (i.e. chatter).

<LI>Solder the resistor into pin 4 of the female DB9 connector.  
</LI>
<LI>Next bend the resistor so that it connects to pin 8 of the female DB9
   connector.  
</LI>
<LI>Pin 8 on the female connector is also wired to pin 5 on the male DB9

</LI>
<LI>Solder the other pins, pin 5 on the female DB9 to pin 4 on the male

   pin 7 on the female connector to pin 1 on the male connector.  
</LI>
<LI>Double check your work.  
   
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
We use the DTR (pin 4 on the female connector) as our +5 volts power for the
circuit. It is used as the Vcc pull-up voltage for testing the outputs on any
``UPS by APC'' in voltage-signalling mode.  This cable may not work on a
BackUPS Pro if the default communications are in apcsmart mode. This cable is
also valid for ``ShareUPS'' BASIC Port mode and is also reported to work on
SmartUPSes. However, the Smart Cable described above is much simpler. To have
a better idea of what is going on inside apcupsd, for the SIMPLE cable apcupsd
reads three signals and sets three: 

<P>
<PRE>
     
     Reads:
     CD, which apcupsd uses for the On Battery signal when high.
     
     CTS, which apcupsd uses for the Battery Low signal when high.
     
     RxD (SR), which apcupsd uses for the Line Down
         signal when high. This signal isn't used for much.
     
     Sets:
     DTR, which apcupsd sets when it detects a power failure (generally
          5 to 10 seconds after the CD signal goes high). It
          clears this signal if the CD signal subsequently goes low
          -- i.e. power is restored.
     
     TxD (ST), which apcupsd clears when it detects that the CD signal
          has gone low after having gone high - i.e. power is restored.
     
     RTS, which apcupsd sets for the killpower signal -- to cause the UPS
          to shut off the power.
</PRE>
<P>
Please note that these actions apply only to the SIMPLE cable, the signals
used on the other cables are different.

<A NAME="index-Voltage-Signalling_002c-Cables-198"></A><A NAME="index-Cables_002c-Voltage-Signalling-199"></A>Apparently, all APC voltage-signalling UPSes have the same signals on the
output pins of the UPS. The difference at the computer end is due to different
cable configurations. Thus, by measuring the connectivity of a cable, one can
determine how to program the UPS. This is to be verified.  

<P>
The signals presented or accepted by the UPS on its DB9 connector using the
numbering scheme listed above is: 

<P>
<PRE>
     
     UPS Pin         Signal meaning
      1     &lt;-     Shutdown when set by computer for 1-5 seconds.
      2     -&gt;     On battery power (this signal is normally low but
                         goes high when the UPS switches to batteries).
      3     -&gt;     Mains down (line fail) See Note 1 below.
      5     -&gt;     Low battery. See Note 1 below.
      6     -&gt;     Inverse of mains down signal. See Note 2 below.
      7     &lt;-     Turn on/off power (only on advanced UPSes only)
     
      Note 1: these two lines are normally open, but close when the
          appropriate signal is triggered. In fact, they are open collector
          outputs which are rated for a maximum of +40VDC and 25 mA. Thus
          the 4.7K ohm resistor used in the Custom Simple cable works
          quite well.
     
      Note 2: the same as note 1 except that the line is normally closed,
          and opens when the line voltage fails.

     Operation:
     
     * DTR is "cable power" and must be held at SPACE.  DSR or CTS may be
     used as a loopback input to determine if the cable is plugged in.
     
     * DCD is the "battery low" signal to the computer.  A SPACE on this
     line means the battery is low.  This is signalled by BATTERY-LOW
     being pulled down (it is probably open circuit normally).
     
     Normally, the transistor is turned off, and DCD is held at the MARK
     voltage by TxD.  When BATTERY-LOW is pulled down, the voltage
     divider R2/R1 biases the transistor so that it is turned on, causing
     DCD to be pulled up to the SPACE voltage.
     
     * TxD must be held at MARK; this is the default state when no data is
     being transmitted.  This sets the default bias for both DCD and
     SHUTDOWN.  If this line is an open circuit, then when BATTERY-LOW is
     signalled, SHUTDOWN will be automatically signalled; this would be
     true if the cable were plugged in to the UPS and not the computer,
     or if the computer were turned off.
     
     * RTS is the "shutdown" signal from the computer.  A SPACE on this
     line tells the UPS to shut down.
     
     * RxD and RI are both the "power-fail" signals to the computer.  A
     MARK on this line means the power has failed.
     
     * SPACE is a positive voltage, typically +12V.  MARK is a negative
     voltage, typically -12V.  Linux appears to translate SPACE to a 1
     and MARK to a 0.

BackUPS ES and CS in Serial mode with Cable 940-0128A:</A>
</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="index-BackUPS-ES-211"></A><A NAME="index-Cables-212"></A>Though these UPSes are USB UPSes, APC supplies a serial cable (typically with
a green DB9 F connector) that has 940-0128A stamped into one side of the
plastic serial port connector. The other end of the cable is a 10 pin RJ45
connector that plugs into the UPS (thanks to Dean Waldow for sending me a
cable!). Apcupsd version 3.8.5 and later supports this cable when specified as
<B>UPSCABLE 940-0128A</B> and <B>UPSTYPE backups</B>. However, running in this
mode much of the information that would be available in USB mode is lost. In
addition, when apcupsd attempts to instruct the UPS to kill the power, it
begins cycling about 4 times a second between battery and line. The solution
to the problem (thanks to Tom Suzda) is to unplug the UPS and while it is
still chattering, press the power button (on the front of the unit) until the
unit beeps and the chattering stops. After that the UPS should behave normally
and power down 1-2 minutes after requested to do so.  

<P>
An amazing discovery by slither_man allows one to build a CUSTOM-RJ45 cable
(documented above) and run the BackUPS CS (and probably also the ES) in Smart
mode. Running it this way provides all the same information that you would get
by running it in USB mode. As a consequence, we recommend that you either
purchase (where I don't know) or build your own CUSTOM-RJ45 cable rather than
use the 940-0128A cable.

Thanks to all the people who have helped test this and have provided
information on the cable wiring, our best guess for the cable schematic is the

From Jan Babinski jbabinsk at pulsarbeacon dot com: (many thanks)  

<P>
The BackUPS XS1000(BX-1000) ships with the 940-0127B usb cable and the
optional 940-0128D serial cable. I'm trying to get it running under OpenBSD so
usb is out of the question. I've tried smart serial with the custom cable, but
that's not working, so I'm stuck with dumb serial over 940-0128D.  

<P>
I have noticed that this cable is not supported by apcupsd so I set out to
find out how much different this cable is compared with the supported ones.
After tearing the cable apart (see schematic below) I noticed that it is
functionally similar to the 940-0128A cable except for NC on (6) DTR and (2)
RD on the computer side.

<A NAME="index-Cables-213"></A><A NAME="index-Windows-214"></A>Due to inadequacies in the Win32 API, it is not possible to set/clear/get all
the serial port line signals. apcupsd can detect: CTS, DSR, RNG, and CD. It
can set and clear: RTS and DTR.  

<P>
This imposes a few minor restrictions on the functionality of some of the
cables. In particular, LineDown on the Custom Simple cable, and Low Battery on
the 0023A cable are not implemented.

Testing Serial-Line UPSes

<P>
<A NAME="index-Testing_002c-Serial-219"></A><A NAME="index-Serial_002c-Testing-220"></A>If you have a serial-line UPS, there are some tests you should run before the
general ones described in the Testing (see 
<A HREF="#Testing-Apcupsd">Testing Apcupsd</A>) section.  

<P>
To test your computer's connection with a serial-line UPS, you first need to
establish that the serial line is functioning, and then that the UPS is
responding to commands.  This can be a bit tricky, especially with a dumb
voltage-signalling interface, because it is completely quiescent when there
are no commands being passed, and the command repertoire doesn't include any
self-tests.  

<P>
Because it is easy to configure a serial cable incorrectly in such a way as to
cause premature shutdowns of the UPS power, we <I>strongly</I> recommend,
especially for voltage- signaling (dumb) UPSes, that you do most of the
initial testing with your computer plugged into the wall rather than your UPS.
Thus if the UPS power is suddenly shut off, your computer will continue to
run. We also recommend using safe-apccontrol as described below, until you are
sure that the signaling is correct.  

<P>
Also note that if you launch the execution of apcupsd while your
voltage-signaling UPS is on battery power, it is very likely that your UPS
will immediately shut off the power. This is due to the initialization of the
serial port line signals, which often looks to the UPS like a shutdown
command.  

<P>
Finally, double-check the state of your cabling and UPS indicator lights
frequently during testing.  For voltage-signaling UPSes, apcupsd is not
currently able to detect whether or not the serial cable is connected. In
addition, some simple signaling UPSes with certain cable combinations are not
able to detect the low battery condition.  For more details please see 
<A HREF="#Voltage-Signalling-Features-Supported-by-Apcupsd-for-Various-Cables">Voltage Signalling Features Supported by Apcupsd for Various
Cables</A>.

Establishing Serial Port Connection
</H2>
<A NAME="6342"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Testing_002c-Serial-221"></A>Once you have compiled, installed, and invoked apcupsd, you should wait to
allow apcupsd to configure itself and establish contact with the UPS.  

<P>
If you see the following message about 30 seconds after starting apcupsd: 

<P>
<PRE>
     apcupsd FATAL ERROR in apcserial.c at line 156
     PANIC! Cannot communicate with UPS via serial port.
</PRE>
<P>
it means that apcupsd tried for about 30 seconds to establish contact with the
UPS via the serial port, but was unable to do so. Before continuing, you must
correct this problem. Some of the possible sources of the problem are:  

<P>

<UL>
<LI>You have not configured the correct serial port name on the DEVICE
   directive in your apcupsd configuration file.  
</LI>
<LI>The serial port that you have chosen has logins enabled. You must
   disable logins on that port, otherwise, the system prevents apcupsd from using
   it. Normally, the file /etc/inittab specifies the ports for which a getty
process is started (on Sun machines, the serial port program equivalent to
getty is called ttymon). You must disable this for the port that you wish to
use.  
</LI>
<LI>Make sure you are doing your testing as <B>root</B> otherwise, you may
   have permissions problems accessing the serial port.  
</LI>
<LI>You may have cabling problems, either with an incorrect cable, or the
   incorrect cable specification directive in the configuration file.  
</LI>
<LI>You may have a problem with the /etc/apcupsd/acpupsd.conf file. For
   example, check that you have specified the correct type of UPS and the correct
   networking directives.  For more details, see the 
<A HREF="#After-Installation">After Installation</A>.  
</LI>
<LI>If you have a SmartUPS 5000 RM 15U or similar model, that comes with a
   ``Web/SNMP management card'' in one of the ``Smart Slots'', this card may
   interfere with the serial port operation. If you are having problems, please
remove this card and try again. Supposedly V3.0 of the card firmware has been
corrected to properly release the serial port.  
</LI>
<LI>Ensure that you have no other programs that are using the serial port.
   One user reported that he had problems because the serial port mouse (gpm) was
   using the same port as apcupsd. This causes intermittent seemingly random
problems.  
</LI>
<LI>If you are using a WinNT or Win2000 machine, the OS is probably
   attempting to attach a serial mouse to the port you are using (COM1 or COM2).
   To prevent this, edit your c:&#92;boot.ini file, and you will find
a line that looks something like the following:  

<P>
<PRE>
          multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT="Windows NT Workstation Version 4.00"
</PRE>
<P>
Add the following to the end of the line: /NoSerialMice:COM1 (or COM2) so that
the new line looks like:  

<P>
<PRE>
          multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT="Windows NT Workstation Version 4.00" /NoSerialMice:COM1
</PRE>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>If you are using a WinNT or Win2000 machine, try connecting apcupsd to
   COM2 rather than COM1 (be sure to change your
   c:&#92;apcupsd&#92;etc&#92;apcupsd&#92;
apcupsd.conf to reflect the change).  
</LI>
<LI>If you are using a Solaris machine, you may have similar problems as
   described above for the WinNT machine. A possible fix is documented in the Sun
   section of the Configuration chapter of this manual.  
</LI>
<LI>Try connecting your UPS to another machine. If it works, then you
   probably have a bad serial port card. As unlikely as this may sound, at least
   two of our users have had to replace bad serial port cards.  
</LI>
<LI>Try doing an <TT>lsof /dev/ttyS0</TT> where you replace the <B>   /dev/ttyS0</B> with your serial port name. If you get no output, the port is free
   (or there is no physical port). If you get output, then another program is
using the port, and you should see which one.  
</LI>
<LI>Try doing a <TT>dmesg | grep tty</TT>. This may show you if a program has
   grabbed the port. (Thanks to Joe Acosta for the suggestion.)  
</LI>
<LI>If all else fails, make sure your system is configured for serial port
   support.  
</LI>
<LI>If you are running Linux, check your /proc file system. For example:
   <TT>cat /proc/devices</TT> should print something like <I>4 ttyS</I> if you have a
   serial port. If your serial port is working, a <TT>cat /proc/interrupts</TT>
should show the serial port usage (e.g. <B>4: 294553 XT-PIC serial</B>) Also,
<TT>cat /proc/ioports</TT> should show up something like <B>03f8-03ff :
serial(auto)</B>. Or, <TT>cat /proc/tty</TT> should print a line like <B>serial
/dev/ttyS 4 64-127 serial</B>. Finally, a <TT>cat /proc/tty/driver/serial</TT>
should print something like the following:

</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The first thing to do is to look at your log file, usually /var/log/messages
because apcupsd writes more detailed information to the log file whenever
there is an error.  

<P>
If you have a UPS that uses apcsmart protcol (see table of types (see 
<A HREF="#type_005ftable">type_table</A>) for a list of the UPSes using
these protocols), you can manually test the serial communications with the UPS
by starting a serial port communications program (such as minicom, tip, or cu)
with the settings 2400 8N1 (2400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit). Be
extremely careful what you send to your UPS as certain characters may cause it
to power down or may even cause damage to the UPS. Try sending an upper case Y
to the UPS (without a return at the end). It should respond with SM. If this
is not the case, review the possible problems listed above. If you fat finger
the Y and enter y instead, no cause for alarm, you will simply get the APC
copyright notice.  

<P>
Once you are sure that serial port communications is working, proceed to the
next test.

     Hello, this is the apcupsd Cable Test program.
     This part of apctest is for testing dumb UPSes (ones that uses signaling rather than commands.
     Most tests enter a loop polling every second for 10 seconds.
</PRE>
<P>
Then it will present you with the following list of choices: 

<P>
<PRE>
     1) Test 1 - normal mode
     2) Test 2 - no cable
     3) Test 3 - no power
     4) Test 4 - low battery (requires test 3 first)
     5) Test 5 - battery exhausted
     6) Test 6 - kill UPS power
     7) Test 7 - run tests 1 through 5
     8) Guess which is the appropriate cable
     9) quit
     
     Select test number:
</PRE>
<P>
Run tests 1, 2, and 3. Note, none of the currently supported cables will
indicate a change for test 2. You can then run test 8 to see what cable it
thinks you should be using. Finally run test 4.  

<P>
apctest can also be run for Smart UPSes.  

<P>
The print out of your testing will be written to the file apctest.output. If
you are unable to solve your problem, you can try posting that file to the
development mailing list, and perhaps we can help you. In this case, please
also include information on your operating system, which version of apcupsd
you are using, your UPS model, and also your apcupsd.conf file.

Determining Which Voltage-Signaling Cable You Have

<A NAME="6434"></A>

<P>
<I>The most frequently encountered problem with voltage-signalling UPSes
(e.g. BackUPS 650) is that you have incorrectly specified which cable is being
used.</I> All cables furnished by APC have the cable number stamped on the side
of the computer connector end of the cable. Using this number with apcupsd
will normally work fine. If you do not know what cable you have, you can use
the apctest program to determine the type of the cable.  

<P>
For simple signaling UPSes, you should <I>not</I> use <B>simple</B> in the cable
specification (i.e. <B>UPSCABLE simple</B>) unless you have made the cable
yourself according to the wiring diagram given in the cables chapter of this
manual.

<A NAME="index-Testing-230"></A>Once you have established that apcupsd can talk to the UPS over the serial

<P>
In one case, a user reported that he received random incorrect values from the
UPS in the status output. It turned out that gpm, the mouse control program
for command windows, was using the serial port without using the standard Unix
locking mechanism. As a consequence, both apcupsd and gpm were reading the
serial port. Please ensure that if you are running gpm that it is not
configured with a serial port mouse on the same serial port.

Recalibrating the UPS Runtime
</H1>
<A NAME="6457"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Runtime-recalibration-231"></A><A NAME="index-Recalibration-Runtime-232"></A>Note: In a future release of apcupsd this procedure will be replaced by a
daemon operation that can be performed on all types of UPS.  

<P>
This section does not apply to voltage-signalling or dumb UPSes such as the
older BackUPS models.  

<P>
Smart UPSes internally compute the remaining runtime, and apcupsd uses the
value supplied by the UPS. As the batteries age (after say two or three
years), the runtime computation may no longer be accurate since the batteries
no longer hold the same charge. As a consequence, in the event of a power
failure, the UPS and thus apcupsd can report a runtime of 5 minutes remaining
when in fact only one minute remains. This can lead to a shutdown before you
might expect it, because regardless of the runtime remaining that is reported,
the UPS will always correctly detect low batteries and report it, thus causing
apcupsd to correctly shutdown your computer.  

<P>
If you wish to have the UPS recalibrate the remaining runtime calculations,
you can do so manually as the current version of apcupsd does not support this
feature. To do so,  

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Shutdown apcupsd  
</LI>
<LI>contact your UPS directly using some terminal program such as minicom,
   tip, or cu with the settings 2400 8N1 (2400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop
   bit). Be extremely careful what you send to your UPS as certain characters may
cause it to power down or may even cause damage to the UPS. Try sending an
upper case Y to the UPS (without a return at the end). It should respond with
SM. If this is not the case, read the chapter on testing. If you fat finger
the Y and enter y instead, no cause for alarm, you will simply get the APC
copyright notice.  
</LI>
<LI>when you are sure you are properly connected send an upper case D (no
   cr). This will put the UPS into calibration mode, and it will drain the
   battery down to 25% capacity (35% for a Matrix) at which point it will go
back on the mains. In doing so, it will recompute the runtime calibration.  
</LI>
<LI>If you wish to abort the calibration, enter a second D command.  
</LI>
<LI>When you are done, restart apcupsd. 
   
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In principle, you should be able to do this with the computer powered by the
UPS, but if you wish to be completely safe, you should plug your computer into
the wall prior to performing the runtime calibration. In that case, you will
need to artificially load the UPS with light bulbs or other means. You should
supply a load of about 30 to 35% but not more than 50%. You can determine
the load by looking at the output of the <TT>apcaccess status</TT> command while
apcupsd is running.  

<P>
You should not run the recalibration command more than once or twice per year
as discharging these kinds of batteries tends to shorten their life span.

Serial-line UPSes that speak the apcsmart protocol log all of the events
described in the Status Format (see

the Technical Reference.  Voltage-signalling UPSes, on the other hand, have a
much narrower data channel.  They can only report a small handful of
conditions.

<A NAME="index-Logging_002c-DATA-233"></A><A NAME="index-DATA-Logging-234"></A>This feature is somewhat outdated and not often used.  

<P>
Data logging consists of periodically logging important data concerning the
operation of the UPS. For the definitive definition of the format, see
log_data() in apcreports.c. The format varies according to the UPS model and
the information available from the UPS.  

<P>
For UPS models, NBKPRO, SMART, SHARESMART, and MATRIX, the output is written
in a format very similar to what PowerChute writes. That is:  

<P>
MinLineVoltage, MaxLineVoltage, OutputVoltage, BatteryVoltage, LineFrequency,
LoadPercent, UPSTemperature,AmbientTemperature,Humidity,LineVoltage,
BatteryCharge,toggle  

<P>
Any value that is not supported by your UPS such as AmbientTemperature and
Humidity will be blank or possibly as 0.0. In any case the commas before and
after that field will still be output. The toggle value alternates from 0 to 1
on each line. This was added at user request so that no two adjacent samples
are identical.

</PRE>
<P>
The <TT><code>--</code>with-upscable=</TT> option of <TT>./configure</TT> can be used to set a
default for this directive during the your build.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>DEVICE &lt;name of device&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7860"></A>
   Specify which device is used for UPS communications. For serial ports, it is
usually something like /dev/ttyS0. For USB ports, you may leave the name of
the device blank (no specification) and apcupsd will automatically search the
standard locations for the UPS.  

<P>
Normally, the <TT>./configure</TT> program will set an appropriate default value.
You may also specify the <TT><code>--</code>with-serial-dev=</TT> option of the <TT>./configure</TT> program to set this directive at build time.  

<P>
If you have specified <B>UPSTYPE net</B>, then the device name to be specified
consists of <B>hostname:port</B> where the hostname is the fully qualified name
or IP address of the host (NIS server) and the port (optional) is the port to
use to contact the server.  

<P>
If you specified <B>UPSTYPE snmp</B>, then the device name becomes <B>hostname:vendor:community</B>. Please see the SNMP chapter (see 
<A HREF="#Support-for-SNMP-UPSes">Support for SNMP UPSes</A>) in this
manual for more details.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>LOCKFILE &lt;path to lockfile&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7861"></A>
   This option tells apcupsd where to create a lockfile for the USB or serial
port in the specified directory. This is important to keep two programs from
reading or writing the port at the same time. Please note that although the
directive name is LOCKFILE, you are actually specifying the lock file path.
apcupsd automatically appends the name of the device when creating the file.
On most systems, this directive is automatically set by the <TT>./configure</TT>
program.  You may also explicitly set it during the build process by using the
<TT><code>--</code>with-lock-dir=</TT> option of the <TT>./configure</TT> program.

<A NAME="6558"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Directives_002c-Network-241"></A><A NAME="index-Network-directives-242"></A>None of these directives are required for proper operation of apcupsd. For the
Network Information Server to work, it must be enabled in the configuration
(default) with <TT><code>--</code>enable-nis</TT>  

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>NETSERVER [on | off]</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="6564"></A>
   This configuration directive turns the network information server on or off.
If it is on, apcupsd will spawn a child process that serves STATUS and EVENTS
information over the network. This information is currently used by the
Web-based CGI programs. The default is on. In some cases, for added security,
you may want to invoke a separate information server daemon from the inetd
daemon. In that case, <I>NETSERVER</I> should be <I>off</I>.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>NISIP &lt;IP-address&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7862"></A>
   This directive specifies the IP address of the network interface on which
the NIS server will listen for incoming connections. Default value is 0.0.0.0
which means the NIS will listen for connections on all network interfaces. If
your machine has more than one interface, you can specify the IP of a single
interface to limit connections to only that interface. Furthermore, you can
specify the loopback address (127.0.0.1) to accept connections only from the 
local machine. You may also use the <TT><code>--</code>with-nisip=</TT> option of the
<TT>./configure</TT> program to set this directive during the build.  

<P>
This directive does not work on Win32 machines because inet_ipton() is not
implemented there.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>NISPORT &lt;port&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7863"></A>
   This configuration directive specifies the port to be used by the apcupsd
Network Information Server. The default is platform dependent, but typically
3551, which we have received from IANA as the official apcupsd networking
port. If you change this port, you must manually change the #define
SERV_TCP_PORT in cgi/upsfetch.c and rebuild the CGI programs. An alternative
is to use the <TT><code>--</code>with-nis-port=</TT> option of the <TT>./configure</TT> program
during the build. In this case, all the appropriate locations will be
automatically changed.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>EVENTSFILE &lt;filename&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7864"></A>
   If you want the apcupsd network information server to provide the last 10
events via the network, you must specify a file where apcupsd will save these
events. The default is: /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events. Currently, apcupsd will
save at most the last 50 events. Periodically (once an hour by default),
apcupsd will check the size of this file. When more than 50 events are
recorded, apcupsd will truncate the file to the most recent 10 events.
Consequently this file will not grow indefinitely. Although we do not
recommend it, you may change these values by editing apcevents.c and changing
the appropriate defines. Be aware that if you set these values to very large
numbers, apcupsd may make excessive memory demands on the system during the
data access and file truncation operations.  

<P>
This filename may also be specified at build time by using the <TT><code>--</code>with-log-dir=</TT> option of the <TT>./configure</TT> program.

<P>
<A NAME="index-Directives_002c-Power-fail-243"></A><A NAME="index-Power-fail-directives-244"></A>In general, none of these directives are required. However, if you have a
voltage-signalling (dumb) UPS with a cable that does not support the Low
Battery signal, you must set the TIMEOUT directive to force a shutdown. Please
see the Cables (see 
<A HREF="#Cables">Cables</A>) section of this manual for more details.  

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>ANNOY &lt;time in seconds&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7865"></A>
   Specify the time in seconds between messages requesting logged in users to get
off the system during a power failure. This timer starts only when the UPS is
running on batteries. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes). apcupsd sends
the annoy messages by invoking the apccontrol script with the <TT>annoyme</TT>
argument. The default is to send a wall message on Unix systems and a popup
message in Windows.  

<P>
The value of <B>ANNOYDELAY</B> must be greater than the value of <B>ANNOY</B> in
order to receive annoy messages (this doesn't make sense, and means that the
default values do not generate annoy messages: KES).  

<P>
Note that if <B>NOLOGON</B> is set to <B>disable</B> the annoy messages will
also be disabled.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ANNOYDELAY &lt;time in seconds&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7866"></A>
   Specify delay time in seconds before apcupsd begins requesting logged in users
to get off the system during a power failure. This timer starts only after the
UPS is running on batteries. This timer is reset when the power returns. The
default is 60 seconds. Thus, the first warning to log off the system occurs
after 60 seconds on batteries, assuming that <B>NOLOGON</B> is not set to <B>disable</B>.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>NOLOGON &lt;specifies when apcupsd should prevent user
   logins&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7867"></A>
[ disable | timeout | percent | minutes | always ] are valid types.  

<P>
The type specified allows you define the point when apcupsd will create the
/etc/nologin file and thus when user logins are prohibited. Once the
/etc/nologin file is created, normal users are prevented from logging in.
Control of when this file is created is important for allowing systems with
big UPSes to run as normally until the system administrator determines the
need for preventing user logins. The feature also allows the system
administrator to hold the ``ANNOY'' factor until the /etc/nologin file is
created. The default is always if no NOLOGON directive is specified.  

<P>
As far as I can tell, the only useful types are disable and always since the
difference in the time when the logout warning is given and shutdown occurs
for the other types is very short (KES).  

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>disable</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="6618"></A>
   prevents apcupsd from creating the nologin file.  Consequently, any user can
login during a power failure condition.  Also, the ANNOY feature is disabled
so users will not be warned to logoff the system.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>timeout</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="6619"></A>
   specifies that apcupsd should prohibit logins after the UPS is on batteries
for 90% of the time specified on the <B>TIMEOUT</B> configuration directive.
Note! Normally you don't want to specify a TIMEOUT value, so this option is
probably not too useful (KES).  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>percent</STRONG></DT>

   specifies that apcupsd should prohibit logins when the remaining battery
charge percentage reaches 110% or less than the value specified on the <B>BATTERYLEVEL</B> configuration directive. Thus if the <B>BATTERYLEVEL</B> is

   <A NAME="7869"></A>
   If BATTERYLEVEL is specified, during a power failure, apcupsd will halt the
system when the remaining battery charge falls below the specified percentage.
The default is 5 percent. This directive is ignored for dumb
(voltage-signalling) UPSes. To totally disable this counter, set <B>BATTERYLEVEL -1</B> in your apcupsd.conf file.

<DD><B>MINUTES &lt;battery runtime in minutes&gt;</B>
   <A NAME="7871"></A>
   If MINUTES is specified, during a power failure, apcupsd will shutdown the
system when the remaining runtime on batteries as internally calculated by the
UPS falls below the time specified. The default is 3. This directive is
ignored for dumb (voltage-signalling) UPSes. It should be noted that some
UPSes report an incorrect value for remaining runtime when the battery is
fully charged. This can be checked by examining the <B>TIMELEFT</B> value as
printed in the output of an <TT>apcaccess status</TT> command. If the value is
zero or otherwise unreasonable, your UPS is probably broken. In this case, we
recommend that you disable this timer by setting <B>MINUTES -1</B> in your
apcupsd.conf file.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><B>TIMEOUT &lt;time in seconds&gt;</B>
   <A NAME="7873"></A>
   After a power failure, apcupsd will halt the system when TIMEOUT seconds have
expired.  A value of zero disables this timer. Normally for all Smart UPS
models and dumb UPSes with cables that support low battery detection, this
should be zero so that the shutdown time will be determined by the battery
level and/or remaining runtime (see above) or in the case of a
voltage-signalling UPS, when the battery is exhausted.  This command is
required for dumb UPSes that do not provide a battery exhausted signal (only
testing can determine this point).  For more information, see the Testing (see

<P>
<A HREF="#Testing-Apcupsd">Testing Apcupsd</A>) section of this manual. 
This timer can also be useful if you want some slave machines to shutdown
before other machines to conserve battery power.  It is also useful for
testing apcupsd because you can force a rapid shutdown by setting a small
value (e.g.  60) and pulling the plug to the UPS.  

<P>
When apcupsd is running in master mode (UPSCLASS netmaster), and a shutdown
condition is determined, apcupsd will notify each of the slaves to perform a
shutdown then apcupsd will sleep for 30 seconds before issuing the shutdown of
its own computer. If you need the master to wait additional time before
shutting down (to allow for shutdown of slower slaves or of slaves running
software that requires more time to shutdown - e.g. databases), you can do
so by adding additional sleep() commands to /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol in each
case that causes a shutdown.  

<P>
<B>TIMEOUT</B>, <B>BATTERYLEVEL</B>, and <B>MINUTES</B> can be set together
without problems.  apcupsd will react to the first case or test that is valid.
Normally SmartUPS users will set <B>TIMEOUT</B> to zero so that the system is
shutdown depending on the percentage battery charge remaining (<B>BATTERYLEVEL</B>) or the remaining battery runtime (<B>MINUTES</B>).

<P>
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><B>KILLDELAY &lt;time in seconds&gt;</B>
   <A NAME="7875"></A>
   If killdelay is set, apcupsd will continue running after a shutdown has been
requested, and after the specified time in seconds, apcupsd will attempt to
shut off the UPS the power. This directive should normally be disabled by
setting the value to zero, but on some systems such as Win32 systems apcupsd
cannot regain control after a shutdown to force the UPS to shut off the power.
In this case, with proper consideration for the timing, the <B>KILLDELAY</B>
directive can be useful.  Please be aware, if you cause apcupsd to kill the
power to your computer too early, the system and the disks may not have been
properly prepared.  In addition, apcupsd must continue running after the
shutdown is requested, and on Unix systems, this is not normally the case as
the system will terminate all processes during the shutdown.

Configuration Directives for Sharing a UPS
</H2>
<A NAME="6698"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Directives-Sharing-247"></A>The following directives apply to the master/slave networking mode of apcupsd
where multiple machines can be powered by the same UPS. One machine, the
master, will have a serial port connection to the UPS, and the other machines,
the slaves, will obtain their information via the network from the master.  

<P>
Note, as of version 3.10.x, the old master/slave code is by default turned off
in the configuration. You must explicitly enable it by including a <TT><code>--</code>enable-master-slave</TT> option on your <TT>./configure</TT> command before
building the source.  

<P>
In addition to the old master/slave code, there is now a new network driver
enabled with <TT><code>--</code>enable-net</TT> (default disabled) that can be used to control
a slave from any version of apcupsd running NIS. This is a much more flexible
system of controlling slaves because a slave machine that also has NIS turned
on can thus act as a master for another slave with <TT><code>--</code>enable-net</TT> turned
on. With this mode turned on, the slave obtains the address of the master from
the <B>DEVICE</B> directive, which takes the form <B>hostname[:port]</B> as a
consequence, none of the directives apply for this form of networking. In
addition, for this mode to work, you must specify <B>UPSTYPE net</B> so that
the proper driver is loaded.  

<P>
The remainder of this section presents directives that apply to the old
master/slave code that must be enabled by the <B>enable-master-slave</B>
configuration option.  

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>UPSCLASS &lt;class of operation&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7880"></A>
   [ standalone | shareslave | sharemaster ] and [ netslave | netmaster ] are
valid types. [ standalone | netslave | netmaster ] are tested classes. [
shareslave | sharemaster ] classes are being tested.  

<P>
The default is <B>standalone</B> and should be used for all machines powered by
the UPS and having a serial port connection to the UPS, but where there are no
other computers dependent on power from the same UPS. This is the normal case.

<P>
Use <B>netmaster</B>, if and only if you have a serial port connection to the
UPS and there are other machines deriving power from the same UPS. This is
required in all master configuration files.  

<P>
Use <B>netslave</B> if and only if you have no serial port connection to the
UPS, but you derive power from it. This is required in all slave configuration
files, and in this case, you will also have UPSCABLE set to ether.  

<P>
Use <B>shareslave</B> if and only if you are using a ShareUPS and connected to
a BASIC Port with Simple Signal. This code is not fully tested.  

<P>
Use <B>sharemaster</B>, if and only if you are using a ShareUPS and connected
to the ADVANCED Port Smart Signal control. This code is not fully tested.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>UPSMODE [disable | share | net | sharenet ] are valid types.</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="6719"></A>
   [ disable | net ] are the only known and tested classes.  

<P>
[ share | sharenet ] classes are being tested.  

<P>
For normal standalone operations, you will set UPSMODE to disable to indicate
that you are disabling the master/slave networking.  

<P>
However, if you are using a single UPS to power several computers and you have
configured master and slave computers, then set this value to net.  

<P>
Use share for two or seven (2/7) additional simple signal ports on a
SmartAccessories(tm) (internal/external box) for SmartUPSes. The share and
sharenet code is not fully tested.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>NETTIME &lt;time in seconds&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7881"></A>
   The interval in seconds that the master uses to send information to slave
machines. This rate is automatically set to 1 second if the UPS goes on
batteries and reset to your specified value when the mains power returns. A
typical value might be 60 seconds.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>NETPORT &lt;IP port number&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7882"></A>
   This port number is used for communications in the master/slave networking
code. Note that the master and each slave must have the same port number
specified on the NETPORT directive in the configuration file. This port may
also be specified during installation by using the <TT><code>--</code>with-net-port=</TT>
option of the <TT>./configure</TT> program.  

<P>
The NETPORT should not be confused with the port number for the Network
Information Server which is specified with the <B>SERVERPORT</B> configuration
directive.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>MASTER &lt;name of the master&gt; for slave machines.</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7883"></A>
   Used in slave configuration files, this is the network name of the master
which is authorized to send commands to this slave. In all cases (of which I
am aware), when you specify a <B>MASTER</B> directive, you will also specify
<B>UPSCABLE ether</B> since your information about the UPS will come via the
network from a master.  

<P>
The slave machine will be shutdown whichever occurs first: either at the
request of the master when it does a shutdown or when the values you have
specified for TIMEOUT, BATTERYLEVEL, or MINUTES expire (these should work but
have not been fully tested). Consequently, if you want the slaves to begin
shutting down before the master, you can do so by adjusting the values in the
configuration file. If you want the slave to remain up until the master shuts
down, you should set TIMEOUT, BATTERYLEVEL, and MINUTES all to zero.  

<P>
For proper functioning of the slave, you must specify the same <B>UPSTYPE</B>
in the slave configuration file as is in the master configuration file.  

<P>
It should be noted that the master and slaves continue to communicate over the
network even after the master has issued a shutdown command to the slaves.
This is because the master apcupsd continues to run until it receives the
shutdown signal from the system. This is important to ensure that all the
slaves have been properly notified of the shutdown.  

<P>
We recommend that the machine names used on the <B>MASTER</B> and <B>SLAVE</B>
directives be put in your /etc/hosts file so that apcupsd will be able to
resolve the machine name during startup and shutdown even if DNS is not
running. Alternatively, you can use IP addresses on the <B>MASTER</B> and <B>SLAVE</B> directives, but this is less flexible.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>SLAVE &lt;name of slave(s)&gt; used only in MASTER configuration
   files.</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7884"></A>
Used in master configuration files, this is the name of a slave machine that
depends on this master. There can be a maximum of 20 slaves attached to one
master. Thus you can specify multiple SLAVE directives in a master
configuration file. Only one slave name can be specified per SLAVE directive,
thus for multiple slaves, specify multiple SLAVE directives.  

<P>
As noted above the master and slaves continue to communicate over the network
even after the master has issued a shutdown command to the slaves. This is
because the master apcupsd continues to run until it receives the shutdown
signal from the system. This is important to ensure that all the slaves have
been properly notified of the shutdown.  

<P>
We recommend that the machine names used on the <B>MASTER</B> and <B>SLAVE</B>
directives be put in your /etc/hosts file so that apcupsd will be able to
resolve the machine name during startup and shutdown even if DNS is not
running. Alternatively, you can use IP addresses on the <B>MASTER</B> and <B>SLAVE</B> directives, but this is less flexible.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>USERMAGIC &lt; user defined magic&gt; used only in SLAVE
   configuration files.</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7885"></A>
The USERMAGIC directive is a sort of password that gives a second level of
identification security in a slave configuration file. It is a character
string up to 17 characters in length. It should be unique for each slave. When
the slave makes initial contact with the master, this string is passed to the
master. Then on each transmission from the master to the slave, the string is
passed back to the slave, which checks that it is the correct string before
accepting the master's information. This string should be different for each
and every slave on the network. This directive is not required.

the values into the UPSes EPROM.  

<P>
Under normal operations, the values for these parameters specified in the

   (H)igh, (M)edium, (L)ow  

<P>
This value determine how sensitive the UPS is to the mains quality and voltage
fluctuations. The more sensitive it is, the quicker the UPS will switch to
battery power when the mains line quality is bad. Normally, this should be set
to H, but if you find your UPS switching to batteries frequently, you might
want to try a less sensitive setting, providing that your computer equipment
tolerates the poor quality mains. This value is written to the UPS EPROM when
the configure option is specified.

<A NAME="index-Logging_002c-Status-250"></A><A NAME="index-Status-logging-251"></A>There is a good deal of information available about the UPS and apcupsd's

</H2>
<A NAME="6839"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Status-Report-252"></A><A NAME="index-Report_002c-Status-253"></A>The STATUS output is in ASCII format with a single data value or piece of
information on each line output. Because not all UPSes supply the same
information, the output varies based on the type of UPS that you are using. In
general, if the information is not available for your UPS, the data portion of
the output record will contain an <B>N/A</B> indicating that the information is
not available.  

<P>
Status logging consists of periodically logging ALL available information
concerning the UPS. Since the volume of data is rather large (over 1000 bytes
per status), the STATUS data is not automatically sent to the system log file,
instead, it is written as a series of data records to a specific file
(normally /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.status).  

<P>
After each write, the file is rewound so that the size of the file remains
constant. At the current time, this file is 1135 bytes. The format of this
file is very similar to the old apcupsd procfs file. The STATUS file is kept
for backward compatibility and will be eliminated in a future version of
apcupsd. The preferred method for obtaining this information is from apcaccess
or by using the CGI interface (see 
<A HREF="#apcupsd-Network-Monitoring-_005bCGI_005d-Programs">apcupsd Network Monitoring [CGI]
Programs</A>).  

<P>
To make reading the status data reliable via a named pipe, the first record
written contains a version number, the number of records that follow the first
record, and the total number of bytes in those subsequent records. An actual
example of such a status file (/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.status) is:  

<P>
Consequently, the first record always consists of 24 bytes (23 characters
followed by a newline). This record starts with APC and as indicated in the
example above is followed by 28 records consisting of 675 bytes. The last
record begins with END APC and contains the date and time matching the DATE
record.  

<P>
Documentation of each record needs to be written. In the coming weeks, I plan
to add additional records and possibly change the names of some of the fields.

<P>
When this data is written to a file, it is written as two records, the first
record, and all the other records together. In reading the file, it can be
either be read a record at a time, or in one big read.  

<P>
When this data is written to syslog(), it is written a record at a time. The
first record is the first 24 bytes. By having the number of records and the
size in the first record, the complete status can be reliably reassembled.

</H2>
<A NAME="6930"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Logging-Status-257"></A><A NAME="index-Status_002c-Logging-258"></A>If specified in the configuration file, the STATUS data will also be written
to the system log file. Please note, that it would not normally be wise to
write this data to a normal system log file as there is no mechanism in
syslog() to rewind the file and hence the log file would quickly become
enormous. However, in two cases, it can be very useful to use syslog() to
write this information.  

<P>
The first case is to set up your syslog.conf file so that the data is written
to a named pipe. In this case, normally not more than about 8192 bytes of data
will be kept before it is discarded by the system.  

<P>
The second case is to setup your syslog.conf file so that the status data is
sent to another machine, which presumably then writes it to a named pipe.
Consequently, with this mechanism, provides a simple means of networking
apcupsd STATUS information.  

<P>
Although we mention system logging of STATUS information, we strongly
recommend that you use apcaccess or the CGI interface to get this information.

Shutdown Sequence
</H2>
<A NAME="6947"></A>

<P>
If you experienced so problems with the testing procedures, or if you are
porting apcupsd to another system, or you are simply curious, you may want to
know exactly what is going on during the shutdown process.  

<P>
The shutdown sequence is as follows:  

<P>

<UL>
<LI>apcupsd detects that there is a power problem and it calls <TT>   /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol powerout</TT>, which normally sends a message to all users
   informing them of a potential problem.  
</LI>
<LI>After approximately 5 seconds in the power problem mode, apcupsd calls
   <TT>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol onbattery</TT>, which normally sends a message to all
   users informing them that the UPS is on batteries.  
</LI>
<LI>When one of the conditions listed below occurs, apcupsd issues a
   shutdown command by calling <TT>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol doshutdown</TT>,
   which should perform a shutdown of your system using the system
   shutdown(8) command.  You can modify the behavior by editing the
   /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol script, but doing so will make it more
   complicated to upgrade to the next apcupsd version.

<P>
The conditions that trigger the shutdown can be: running time on batteries
have expired (TIMEOUT), the battery runtime remaining is below the configured
value (BATTERYLEVEL), the estimated remaining runtime is below the configured
value (MINUTES), or the UPS signals that the batteries are exhausted.  

<P>
A shutdown could also be initiated if apcupsd detects that the batteries are
no longer functioning correctly. This case, though very unusual, can happen at
any time even if there is proper mains voltage, and <TT>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol emergency</TT> is called.  

<P>
Just before initiating any shutdown through the apccontrol script, apcupsd
will create the file /etc/apcupsd/powerfail. This file will be used later in
the shutdown sequence to recall apcupsd after syncing of the disks to initiate
a power off of the UPS.  

<P>
If the /etc/nologin file has not already been created, it will normally be
created during the shutdown sequence to prevent additional users from logging
in (see the NOLOGIN configuration directive).  

<P>
Even though apcupsd has requested the system to perform a shutdown, it
continues running. If it is a master with slaves, it will inform the slaves to
do a shutdown. They perform their shutdown by calling <TT>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol remotedown</TT>.  
</LI>
<LI>When the system signals apcupsd to do exit, it does so.  This is part of
   the normal system shutdown (at least on Unix and Linux systems) and the exact
   time that apcupsd receives the termination signal depends on how the shutdown
links (usually in /etc/rc.d) are set.  

<P>
Note that on Windows NT systems, apcupsd apparently continues to run as a
Service even though the machine is ``shutdown''.  
</LI>
<LI>During the shutdown of the system after apcupsd has been forced to exit,
   one of the last things done by the system shutdown is to call the halt script,
   which is usually in /etc/rc.d/halt or /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt, or possibly in
/sbin/init.d/rc.0 depending on your system. If apcupsd was properly installed,
this standard halt script was modified to include a bit of new logic just
before the final halt of the system. It first tests if the file
/etc/apcupsd/powerfail exists, and if it does, it executes <TT>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol killpower</TT>. It is this last step that will cause
apcupsd to be re-executed with the <TT><code>--</code>killpower</TT> option on the command
line. This option tells apcupsd to inform the UPS to kill the power.  

<P>
This final step is important if you want to ensure that your system will
automatically reboot when the power comes back on. The actual code used on the
Red Hat version is:  

<P>
<PRE>
          # See if this is a powerfail situation.                             # ***apcupsd***
          if [ -f /etc/apcupsd/powerfail ]; then                              # ***apcupsd***
           echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
           echo "APCUPSD will now power off the UPS"                          # ***apcupsd***
           echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
           /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol killpower                                  # ***apcupsd***
           echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
           echo "Please ensure that the UPS has powered off before rebooting" # ***apcupsd***
           echo "Otherwise, the UPS may cut the power during the reboot!!!"   # ***apcupsd***
           echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***
          fi                                                                  # ***apcupsd***
</PRE>
<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The above code must be inserted as late as possible in the halt script. On
many systems, such as Red Hat, all the disk drives were unmounted, then
remounted read-only, thus permitting access to the /etc files and the apcupsd
executable. If your system does not explicitly remount the disks, you must
remount them in read-only mode in the code that you add. Examples of code
fragments that do this can be found in the distributions/suse subdirectory of
the source.  

<P>
If you are not able to insert the above code in your halt script because there
is no halt script, or because your halt script calls the init program as some
Unix systems do, you can either just forget about powering off the UPS, which
means that your machine will not automatically reboot after a power failure,
or there is yet another alternative, though not at all as satisfying as
inserting code in the halt script.  

<P>
Only if you cannot insert the appropriate code in the halt script, when you
start apcupsd, normally from the /etc/rc.d/init.d/apcupsd script, use the <TT><code>--</code>kill-on-powerfail</TT> option. This will cause apcupsd to program the UPS to
shutoff the power just before it (apcupsd) does the system shutdown. Please
note that this is not the most ideal solution. Read on to understand why.  

<P>
A very important consideration is that you must set the EEPROM in your UPS so
that it waits a sufficient time for the system to halt before it shuts off the
UPS power. The current value as well as the permitted values for your UPS can
be determined by executing: 

<P>

     apcaccess eeprom

<P>
The line of interest for you is the <B>Shutdown grace delay</B>, which can be
changed using the SLEEP (see 
<A HREF="#SLEEP-_003cset-sleep-delay_003e">SLEEP &lt;set sleep
delay&gt;</A>) directive in your
<B>apcupsd.conf</B> file. The default value is 20 seconds, but generally, you
can set it to 180, 300, or 600 seconds depending on your UPS. See the EEPROM
(see 
<A HREF="#Configuring-Your-EEPROM">Configuring Your EEPROM</A>) this
manual for further details on how to change this EPROM value.

If you use the <TT><code>--</code>kill-on-powerfail</TT> option, you run the risk of having
the computer power cut before the system has shutdown. Even if the grace
period is rather long, if something goes wrong in the shutdown, well, it is up
to you to decide.  

<P>
If apcupsd has successfully shutdown your computer and powered off the UPS
during a power outage, you can control whether or not your computer is
automatically rebooted when the power returns.  

<P>
The UPS contains two internal EPROM values that determine when it will restore
power to your computer after a full power shutdown. They are the RETURNCHARGE
(see 
<A HREF="#RETURNCHARGE-_003cmin_005f-batt_005f-charge-level_003e">RETURNCHARGE &lt;min_ batt_ charge
level&gt;</A>)
percentage and the WAKEUP (see 
<A HREF="#WAKEUP-_003cset-wakeup-delay_003e">WAKEUP &lt;set wakeup
delay&gt;</A>) delay. Briefly, the
<B>RETURNCHARGE</B> specifies what percentage charge the battery must have
before the power is restored. Higher values are recommended in regions where
the power goes up and down frequently. The <B>WAKEUP</B> delay is a simple time
delay. Most sites will have both of these at zero, or perhaps the <B>RETURNCHARGE</B> set to 15. Please follow the links to the <B>Configuration</B>
section of this manual for more information.  See the EEPROM (see 
<A HREF="#Configuring-Your-EEPROM">Configuring Your EEPROM</A>) of this
manual for further details on how to change these EPROM values.

Shutdown Problems

<P>
Obviously if your halt script is not properly modified, apcupsd will not be
able to shut off the power to the UPS, and if the power returns before the
batteries are exhausted your system will not automatically reboot. In any
case, your machine should have been cleanly shut down.

Master/Slave Shutdown
</H2>
<A NAME="6997"></A>

<P>
In master/slave configurations, however, the master cannot be 100 percent sure
that the slaves have all shutdown before it performs the power off. As a
consequence, it is possible that the master will shut off the power before the
slave has finished shutdown. If this is the case, the best procedure is to put
an appropriate sleep command in the /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol file on the
master. For example to give the slaves 30 additional seconds to shutdown, one
would add: 

<P>
<PRE>
     sleep 30
</PRE>
<P>
just after the line that reads 

<P>
<PRE>
     doshutdown)
</PRE>
<P>
in the apccontrol file (approximately line 79 - depending on your system
version).  

<P>
Also, on a slave machine, you do not want to use the modified halt script
since it will recall apcupsd, which will detect that it is a slave (i.e. no
connection to the UPS) and will complain that it cannot do the killpower. This
situation is not harmful just annoying and possibly confusing.  

<P>
One possible problem during shutdown can be caused by remnants of old
versions. Please be sure to delete or rename all prior versions
(/usr/local/sbin/apcupsd or /sbin/powersc).

Startup
</H2>
<A NAME="7008"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="index-Startup-260"></A>Normally, apcupsd is automatically started when your system is rebooted. This
normally occurs because the startup script apcupsd is linked into the
appropriate places in /etc/rc.d. On most Linux systems, there is a program
called chkconfig(8) that will automatically link the startup script.  This
program is invoked by the <TT>make install</TT> scripts, or it is explicitly done
for those systems that do not have chkconfig(8). If this is not the case, you
can either link it in appropriately yourself or explicitly call it from your
rc.local file. The appropriate manual way to startup apcupsd is by executing: 

<P>
<PRE>
     &lt;path&gt;/apcupsd start
</PRE>
<P>
where &lt;path&gt; is normally /etc/rc.d or /etc/rc.d/init.d depending on
your system (isn't Unix wonderful? :-)). Using this script is important so
that any files remaining around after a power failure are removed. Likewise,
shutting down apcupsd should be done with the same script: 

<P>
<PRE>
     &lt;path&gt;/apcupsd stop

The start of this chapter of the apcupsd manual in HTML format was pulled from
the

  HREF="http://www.exploits.org/nut/library/apcsmart.html">Network UPS Tools

site. It has been an
invaluable tool in improving apcupsd, and I consider it the <B>Bible</B> of APC
UPS programming. In the course of using it, I have added information gleaned
from apcupsd and information graciously supplied by APC. Hopefully, the
additions made herein can benefit the original author and his 
<A NAME="tex2html15"
  HREF="http://www.exploits.org/nut">programming project</A>, and maybe some day,
the apcupsd project and the <B>NUT</B> project can join forces.

<P>
Here's the information on the elusive APC smart signaling protocol used by
their higher end units (Back-UPS Pro, Smart-UPS, Matrix-UPS, etc). What you
see here has been collected from a variety of sources. Some people analyzed
the chatter between PowerChute and their hardware. Others sent various
characters to the UPS and figured out what the results meant.

RS-232 differences

<A NAME="7054"></A>

<P>
Normal 9 pin serial connections have TxD on 3 and RxD on 2. APC's smart serial
ports put TxD on pin 1 and RxD on pin 2. This means you go nowhere if you use
a normal straight through serial cable. In fact, you might even power down the
load if you plug one of those cables in. This is due to the odd routing of
pins - DTR and RTS from the PC usually wind up driving the on/off line. So,
when you open the port, they go high and *poof* your computer dies.  

<P>
Originally this evil hack was used to connect the UPS to the PC when this page
was first being built. As you can see, I cheated and neglected the ground
(only 2 wires!) and it still worked. This method can be used for playing
around, but for professional systems this is obviously not a viable option.  

<P>
That hack didn't work out so well (damned cats), so it was retired quite
awhile back. The most practical solution was to go out and BUY the DOS/Win
version of PowerChute just for the black (smart) cable. I recommend doing the
same thing if you actually care about this thing working properly. Of course,
if you have one of the newer packages that came with PowerChute, you already
have the cable you need.

<P>
Despite the lack of official information from APC, this table has been
constructed. It's standard RS-232 serial communications at 2400 bps/8N1. Don't
rush the UPS while transmitting or it may stop talking to you. This isn't a
problem with the normal single character queries, but it really does matter
for multi-char things like ``@000''. Sprinkle a few calls to usleep() in your
code and everything will work a lot better.  

<P>
The following table describes the single character <B>Code</B> or command that
you can send to the UPS, its meaning, and what sort of response the UPS will
provide. Typically, the response shown below is followed by a newline
(&#92;n in C) and a carriage return (&#92;r in C). If
you send the UPS a command that it does not recognize or that is not available
on your UPS, it will normally respond by ``NA'' for not available, otherwise
the response is given in the ``Typical results'' column. &gt;

Upon sending a ^Z, your UPS will probably spit back approximately 254
characters something like the following (truncated here for the example):  

<P>
#uD43132135138129uM43229234239224uA43110112114108 ....  

<P>
It looks bizarre and ugly, but is easily parsed. The # is some kind of
marker/ident character. Skip it. The rest fits this form:  

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Command character - use this to select the value  
</LI>
<LI>Locale - use 'b' to find out what yours is (the last character), '4'
   applies to all  
</LI>
<LI>Number of choices - '4' means there are 4 possibilities coming up  
</LI>
<LI>Choice length - '3' means they are all 3 chars long 
   
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Matrix-UPS models have ## between each grouping for some reason.

<P>
The first two cases (Ident and Batt date) are somewhat special in that you
tell the UPS you want to change the value, then you supply 8 characters that
are saved in the EEPROM. The last ten item are programmed by telling the UPS
that you want it to cycle to the next permitted value.  

<P>
In each case, you indicate to the UPS that you want to change the EEPROM by
first sending the appropriate query command (e.g. ``c'' for the UPS ID or
``u'' for the Upper Transfer voltage. This command is then immediately
followed by the cycle EEPROM command or ``-''. In the case of the UPS Id or
the battery date, you follow the cycle command by the eight characters that
you want to put in the EEPROM. In the case of the other ten items, there is
nothing more to enter.  

<P>
The UPS will respond by ``OK'' and approximately 5 seconds later by a vertical
bar (|) to indicate that the EEPROM was changed.

<DT><STRONG><B>How do I build Apcupsd for platform xxx?</B></STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7712"></A>
   The apcupsd spec file contains defines to build for several platforms: RedHat
7.x (rh7), RedHat 8.0 (rh8), RedHat 9 (rh9), Fedora Core 1 (fc1), and Whitebox
Enterprise Linux 3.0 (wb3).  The package build is controlled by a define set
at the beginning of the file. These defines basically just control the
dependancy information that gets coded into the finished rpm package.  So
while you could technically build a package without defining a platform, or
with an incorrect platform, and have it install and run it would not contain
correct dependancy information for the rpm database.  The platform define may
be edited in the spec file directly (by default all defines are set to 0 or
``not set'').  For example, to build the RedHat 7.x package find the line in
the spec file which reads  

<P>
<PRE>
              %define rh7 0
     </PRE>
<P>
and edit it to read  

<P>
<PRE>
              %define rh7 1
     </PRE>
<P>
Alternately you may pass the define on the command line when calling rpmbuild:

<P>
<PRE>
              rpmbuild -ba --define "build_rh7 1" apcupsd.spec
              rpmbuild --rebuild --define build_rh7 1" apcupsd-x.x.x-x.src.rpm
</PRE>
<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><B>How do I control whether usb support gets built?</B></STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7720"></A>
   By default standard serial port support will be built and the apcupsd-std
package will be produced. To get the usb package and support either set the  

<P>
<PRE>
              %define usb 0
     </PRE>
<P>
to  

<P>
<PRE>
              %define usb 1
     </PRE>
<P>
in the spec file directly or pass it to rpmbuild on the command line:  

<P>
<PRE>
              rpmbuild -ba --define "build_rh7 1" --define "build_usb 1" apcupsd.spec
</PRE>
<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><B>other defines are used?</B></STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7728"></A>
   The only other define is for the initdir for the daemon control script. On
RedHat systems this is set to /etc/rc.d/init.d/.  You would only need to edit
this if packaging for a platform with uses a different directory.  

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><B>I'm getting errors about not having permission when</B></STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="7730"></A>
   I try to build the packages.  Do I need to be root? No, you do not need to be
root and, in fact, it is better practice to build rpm packages as a non-root
user.  Apcupds packages are designed to be built by a regular user but you
must make a few changes on your system to do this.  If you are building on
your own system then the simplest method is to add write permissions for all
to the build directory (/usr/src/redhat/).  To accomplish this execute the
following command as root:  

<P>
<PRE>
              chmod -R 777 /usr/src/redhat
</PRE>
<P>
If you are working on a shared system where you can not use the method above
then you need to recreate the /usr/src/redhat directory tree with all of it's
subdirectories inside your home directory. Then create a file named  

<P>
<PRE>
              .rpmmacros
</PRE>
<P>
in your home directory (or edit the file if it already exists) and add the
following line:  

<P>
<PRE>
              %_topdir /home/myuser/redhat
     </PRE>

Interpreting /proc/bus/usb (linux-2.4)</A>
</H2>
Interpretation of /proc/bus/usb info on 2.4 kernels: 

<P>
<PRE>
     /proc/bus/usb filesystem output
     ===============================
     (version 2002.03.18)
     
     
     The /proc filesystem for USB devices provides /proc/bus/usb/drivers
     and /proc/bus/usb/devices, as well as /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD files.
     
     
     **NOTE**: If /proc/bus/usb appears empty, and a host controller
               driver has been linked, then you need to mount the
               filesystem.  Issue the command (as root):
     
           mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb
     
               An alternative and more permanent method would be to add
     
           none  /proc/bus/usb  usbfs  defaults  0  0
     
               to /etc/fstab.  This will mount usbfs at each reboot.
               You can then issue `cat /proc/bus/usb/devices` to extract
               USB device information, and user mode drivers can use usbfs
               to interact with USB devices.
     
               There are a number of mount options supported by usbfs.
               Consult the source code (linux/drivers/usb/inode.c) for
               information about those options.
     
     **NOTE**: The filesystem has been renamed from "usbdevfs" to
               "usbfs", to reduce confusion with "devfs".  You may
               still see references to the older "usbdevfs" name.
     
     For more information on mounting the usbfs file system, see the
     "USB Device Filesystem" section of the USB Guide. The latest copy
     of the USB Guide can be found at http://www.linux-usb.org/
     
     
     THE /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD FILES:
     --------------------------------
     Each connected USB device has one file.  The BBB indicates the bus
     number.  The DDD indicates the device address on that bus.  Both
     of these numbers are assigned sequentially, and can be reused, so
     you can't rely on them for stable access to devices.  For example,
     it's relatively common for devices to re-enumerate while they are
     still connected (perhaps someone jostled their power supply, hub,
     or USB cable), so a device might be 002/027 when you first connect
     it and 002/048 sometime later.
     
     These files can be read as binary data.  The binary data consists
     of first the device descriptor, then the descriptors for each
     configuration of the device.  That information is also shown in
     text form by the /proc/bus/usb/devices file, described later.
     
     These files may also be used to write user-level drivers for the USB
     devices.  You would open the /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD file read/write,
     read its descriptors to make sure it's the device you expect, and then
     bind to an interface (or perhaps several) using an ioctl call.  You
     would issue more ioctls to the device to communicate to it using
     control, bulk, or other kinds of USB transfers.  The IOCTLs are
     listed in the linux/usbdevice_fs.h file, and at this writing the
     source code (linux/drivers/usb/devio.c) is the primary reference
     for how to access devices through those files.
     
     Note that since by default these BBB/DDD files are writable only by
     root, only root can write such user mode drivers.  You can selectively
     grant read/write permissions to other users by using "chmod".  Also,
     usbfs mount options such as "devmode=0666" may be helpful.
     
     
     
     THE /proc/bus/usb/drivers FILE:
     -------------------------------
     Each of the USB device drivers linked into your kernel (statically,
     or dynamically using "modprobe") is listed in the "drivers" file.
     Here's an example from one system:
     
              usbdevfs
              hub
       0- 15: usblp
              usbnet
              serial
              usb-storage
              pegasus
     
     If you see this file, "usbdevfs" and "hub" will always be listed,
     since those are part of the "usbcore" framework.
     
     Drivers that use the USB major number (180) to provide character devices
     will include a range of minor numbers, as shown above for the "usblp"
     (actually "printer.o") module.  USB device drivers can of course use any
     major number, but it's easy to use the USB range since there's explicit
     support for subdividing it in the USB device driver framework.
     
     
     THE /proc/bus/usb/devices FILE:
     -------------------------------
     In /proc/bus/usb/devices, each device's output has multiple
     lines of ASCII output.
     I made it ASCII instead of binary on purpose, so that someone
     can obtain some useful data from it without the use of an
     auxiliary program.  However, with an auxiliary program, the numbers
     in the first 4 columns of each "T:" line (topology info:
     Lev, Prnt, Port, Cnt) can be used to build a USB topology diagram.
     
     Each line is tagged with a one-character ID for that line:
     
     T = Topology (etc.)
     B = Bandwidth (applies only to USB host controllers, which are
         virtualized as root hubs)
     D = Device descriptor info.
     P = Product ID info. (from Device descriptor, but they won't fit
         together on one line)
     S = String descriptors.
     C = Configuration descriptor info. (* = active configuration)
     I = Interface descriptor info.
     E = Endpoint descriptor info.
     
     =======================================================================
     
     /proc/bus/usb/devices output format:
     
     Legend:
       d = decimal number (may have leading spaces or 0's)

         Speed may be:
             1.5     Mbit/s for low speed USB
             12      Mbit/s for full speed USB
             480     Mbit/s for high speed USB (added for USB 2.0)
     
     
     Bandwidth info:
     B:  Alloc=ddd/ddd us (xx%), #Int=ddd, #Iso=ddd

     |   |                       |__Number of interrupt requests
     |   |__Total Bandwidth allocated to this bus
     |__Bandwidth info tag
     
         Bandwidth allocation is an approximation of how much of one frame
         (millisecond) is in use.  It reflects only periodic transfers, which
         are the only transfers that reserve bandwidth.  Control and bulk
         transfers use all other bandwidth, including reserved bandwidth that
         is not used for transfers (such as for short packets).
     
         The percentage is how much of the "reserved" bandwidth is scheduled by
         those transfers.  For a low or full speed bus (loosely, "USB 1.1"),
         90% of the bus bandwidth is reserved.  For a high speed bus (loosely,
         "USB 2.0") 80% is reserved.

     |   |__Serial Number of this device as read from the device.
     |      For USB host controller drivers (virtual root hubs) this is

     | | |__NumberOfInterfaces
     | |__ "*" indicates the active configuration (others are " ")
     |__Config info tag
     
         USB devices may have multiple configurations, each of which act
         rather differently.  For example, a bus-powered configuration
         might be much less capable than one that is self-powered.  Only
         one device configuration can be active at a time; most devices
         have only one configuration.
     
         Each configuration consists of one or more interfaces.  Each
         interface serves a distinct "function", which is typically bound
         to a different USB device driver.  One common example is a USB
         speaker with an audio interface for playback, and a HID interface
         for use with software volume control.
     
     
     Interface descriptor info (can be multiple per Config):
     
     I:  If#=dd Alt=dd #EPs=dd Cls=xx(sssss) Sub=xx Prot=xx Driver=ssss
     |   |      |      |       |             |      |       |__Driver name
     |   |      |      |       |             |      |          or "(none)"
     |   |      |      |       |             |      |__InterfaceProtocol
     |   |      |      |       |             |__InterfaceSubClass
     |   |      |      |       |__InterfaceClass
     |   |      |      |__NumberOfEndpoints
     |   |      |__AlternateSettingNumber
     |   |__InterfaceNumber
     |__Interface info tag
     
         A given interface may have one or more "alternate" settings.
         For example, default settings may not use more than a small
         amount of periodic bandwidth.  To use significant fractions
         of bus bandwidth, drivers must select a non-default altsetting.
     
         Only one setting for an interface may be active at a time, and
         only one driver may bind to an interface at a time.  Most devices
         have only one alternate setting per interface.
     
     
     Endpoint descriptor info (can be multiple per Interface):
     
     E:  Ad=xx(s) Atr=xx(ssss) MxPS=dddd Ivl=dddms
     |   |        |            |         |__Interval (max) between transfers
     |   |        |            |__EndpointMaxPacketSize
     |   |        |__Attributes(EndpointType)
     |   |__EndpointAddress(I=In,O=Out)
     |__Endpoint info tag
     
         The interval is nonzero for all periodic (interrupt or isochronous)
         endpoints.  For high speed endpoints the transfer interval may be
         measured in microseconds rather than milliseconds.
     
         For high speed periodic endpoints, the "MaxPacketSize" reflects
         the per-microframe data transfer size.  For "high bandwidth"
         endpoints, that can reflect two or three packets (for up to
         3KBytes every 125 usec) per endpoint.
     
         With the Linux-USB stack, periodic bandwidth reservations use the
         transfer intervals and sizes provided by URBs, which can be less
         than those found in endpoint descriptor.
     
     
     =======================================================================
     
     
     If a user or script is interested only in Topology info, for
     example, use something like "grep ^T: /proc/bus/usb/devices"
     for only the Topology lines.  A command like
     "grep -i ^[tdp]: /proc/bus/usb/devices" can be used to list
     only the lines that begin with the characters in square brackets,
     where the valid characters are TDPCIE.  With a slightly more able
     script, it can display any selected lines (for example, only T, D,
     and P lines) and change their output format.  (The "procusb"
     Perl script is the beginning of this idea.  It will list only
     selected lines [selected from TBDPSCIE] or "All" lines from
     /proc/bus/usb/devices.)
     
     The Topology lines can be used to generate a graphic/pictorial
     of the USB devices on a system's root hub.  (See more below
     on how to do this.)
     
     The Interface lines can be used to determine what driver is
     being used for each device.
     
     The Configuration lines could be used to list maximum power
     (in milliamps) that a system's USB devices are using.
     For example, "grep ^C: /proc/bus/usb/devices".
     
     
     Here's an example, from a system which has a UHCI root hub,
     an external hub connected to the root hub, and a mouse and
     a serial converter connected to the external hub.

     Selecting only the "T:" and "I:" lines from this (for example, by using
     "procusb ti"), we have:

Interpretation of /proc/bus/usb info on 2.6 kernels: 

<P>
<PRE>
     /proc/bus/usb filesystem output
     ===============================
     (version 2003.05.30)
     
     
     The usbfs filesystem for USB devices is traditionally mounted at
     /proc/bus/usb.  It provides the /proc/bus/usb/devices file, as well as
     the /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD files.
     
     
     **NOTE**: If /proc/bus/usb appears empty, and a host controller
               driver has been linked, then you need to mount the
               filesystem.  Issue the command (as root):
     
           mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb
     
               An alternative and more permanent method would be to add
     
           none  /proc/bus/usb  usbfs  defaults  0  0
     
               to /etc/fstab.  This will mount usbfs at each reboot.
               You can then issue `cat /proc/bus/usb/devices` to extract
               USB device information, and user mode drivers can use usbfs
               to interact with USB devices.
     
               There are a number of mount options supported by usbfs.
               Consult the source code (linux/drivers/usb/core/inode.c) for
               information about those options.
     
     **NOTE**: The filesystem has been renamed from "usbdevfs" to
               "usbfs", to reduce confusion with "devfs".  You may
               still see references to the older "usbdevfs" name.
     
     For more information on mounting the usbfs file system, see the
     "USB Device Filesystem" section of the USB Guide. The latest copy
     of the USB Guide can be found at http://www.linux-usb.org/
     
     
     THE /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD FILES:
     --------------------------------
     Each connected USB device has one file.  The BBB indicates the bus
     number.  The DDD indicates the device address on that bus.  Both
     of these numbers are assigned sequentially, and can be reused, so
     you can't rely on them for stable access to devices.  For example,
     it's relatively common for devices to re-enumerate while they are
     still connected (perhaps someone jostled their power supply, hub,
     or USB cable), so a device might be 002/027 when you first connect
     it and 002/048 sometime later.
     
     These files can be read as binary data.  The binary data consists
     of first the device descriptor, then the descriptors for each
     configuration of the device.  That information is also shown in
     text form by the /proc/bus/usb/devices file, described later.
     
     These files may also be used to write user-level drivers for the USB
     devices.  You would open the /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD file read/write,
     read its descriptors to make sure it's the device you expect, and then
     bind to an interface (or perhaps several) using an ioctl call.  You
     would issue more ioctls to the device to communicate to it using
     control, bulk, or other kinds of USB transfers.  The IOCTLs are
     listed in the linux/usbdevice_fs.h file, and at this writing the
     source code (linux/drivers/usb/devio.c) is the primary reference
     for how to access devices through those files.
     
     Note that since by default these BBB/DDD files are writable only by
     root, only root can write such user mode drivers.  You can selectively
     grant read/write permissions to other users by using "chmod".  Also,
     usbfs mount options such as "devmode=0666" may be helpful.
     
     
     
     THE /proc/bus/usb/devices FILE:
     -------------------------------
     In /proc/bus/usb/devices, each device's output has multiple
     lines of ASCII output.
     I made it ASCII instead of binary on purpose, so that someone
     can obtain some useful data from it without the use of an
     auxiliary program.  However, with an auxiliary program, the numbers
     in the first 4 columns of each "T:" line (topology info:
     Lev, Prnt, Port, Cnt) can be used to build a USB topology diagram.
     
     Each line is tagged with a one-character ID for that line:
     
     T = Topology (etc.)
     B = Bandwidth (applies only to USB host controllers, which are
         virtualized as root hubs)
     D = Device descriptor info.
     P = Product ID info. (from Device descriptor, but they won't fit
         together on one line)
     S = String descriptors.
     C = Configuration descriptor info. (* = active configuration)
     I = Interface descriptor info.
     E = Endpoint descriptor info.
     
     =======================================================================
     
     /proc/bus/usb/devices output format:
     
     Legend:
       d = decimal number (may have leading spaces or 0's)
       x = hexadecimal number (may have leading spaces or 0's)
       s = string

     |__Topology info tag
     
         Speed may be:
             1.5     Mbit/s for low speed USB
             12      Mbit/s for full speed USB
             480     Mbit/s for high speed USB (added for USB 2.0)
     
     
     Bandwidth info:
     B:  Alloc=ddd/ddd us (xx%), #Int=ddd, #Iso=ddd
     |   |                       |         |__Number of isochronous requests
     |   |                       |__Number of interrupt requests
     |   |__Total Bandwidth allocated to this bus
     |__Bandwidth info tag
     
         Bandwidth allocation is an approximation of how much of one frame
         (millisecond) is in use.  It reflects only periodic transfers, which
         are the only transfers that reserve bandwidth.  Control and bulk
         transfers use all other bandwidth, including reserved bandwidth that
         is not used for transfers (such as for short packets).
     
         The percentage is how much of the "reserved" bandwidth is scheduled by
         those transfers.  For a low or full speed bus (loosely, "USB 1.1"),
         90% of the bus bandwidth is reserved.  For a high speed bus (loosely,
         "USB 2.0") 80% is reserved.

     |__Config info tag
     
         USB devices may have multiple configurations, each of which act
         rather differently.  For example, a bus-powered configuration
         might be much less capable than one that is self-powered.  Only
         one device configuration can be active at a time; most devices
         have only one configuration.
     
         Each configuration consists of one or more interfaces.  Each
         interface serves a distinct "function", which is typically bound
         to a different USB device driver.  One common example is a USB
         speaker with an audio interface for playback, and a HID interface
         for use with software volume control.
     
     
     Interface descriptor info (can be multiple per Config):

     |   |__InterfaceNumber
     |__Interface info tag
     
         A given interface may have one or more "alternate" settings.
         For example, default settings may not use more than a small
         amount of periodic bandwidth.  To use significant fractions
         of bus bandwidth, drivers must select a non-default altsetting.
     
         Only one setting for an interface may be active at a time, and
         only one driver may bind to an interface at a time.  Most devices
         have only one alternate setting per interface.

     |   |        |            |__EndpointMaxPacketSize

     |   |__EndpointAddress(I=In,O=Out)
     |__Endpoint info tag
     
         The interval is nonzero for all periodic (interrupt or isochronous)
         endpoints.  For high speed endpoints the transfer interval may be
         measured in microseconds rather than milliseconds.
     
         For high speed periodic endpoints, the "MaxPacketSize" reflects
         the per-microframe data transfer size.  For "high bandwidth"
         endpoints, that can reflect two or three packets (for up to
         3KBytes every 125 usec) per endpoint.
     
         With the Linux-USB stack, periodic bandwidth reservations use the
         transfer intervals and sizes provided by URBs, which can be less
         than those found in endpoint descriptor.
     
     
     =======================================================================
     
     
     If a user or script is interested only in Topology info, for
     example, use something like "grep ^T: /proc/bus/usb/devices"
     for only the Topology lines.  A command like
     "grep -i ^[tdp]: /proc/bus/usb/devices" can be used to list
     only the lines that begin with the characters in square brackets,
     where the valid characters are TDPCIE.  With a slightly more able
     script, it can display any selected lines (for example, only T, D,
     and P lines) and change their output format.  (The "procusb"
     Perl script is the beginning of this idea.  It will list only
     selected lines [selected from TBDPSCIE] or "All" lines from
     /proc/bus/usb/devices.)
     
     The Topology lines can be used to generate a graphic/pictorial
     of the USB devices on a system's root hub.  (See more below
     on how to do this.)
     
     The Interface lines can be used to determine what driver is
     being used for each device.
     
     The Configuration lines could be used to list maximum power
     (in milliamps) that a system's USB devices are using.
     For example, "grep ^C: /proc/bus/usb/devices".
     
     
     Here's an example, from a system which has a UHCI root hub,
     an external hub connected to the root hub, and a mouse and
     a serial converter connected to the external hub.

     Selecting only the "T:" and "I:" lines from this (for example, by using
     "procusb ti"), we have:
     
     T:  Bus=00 Lev=00 Prnt=00 Port=00 Cnt=00 Dev#=  1 Spd=12  MxCh= 2
     T:  Bus=00 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#=  2 Spd=12  MxCh= 4
