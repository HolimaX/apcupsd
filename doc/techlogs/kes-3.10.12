General:
- Move install.xml to install.kml and implement simpler html directives in
  docbook.  Modify Makefile to convert html back into docbook.
- Change references to serial port in apctest to device (USB included).
- Minor updates to the documentation from user input.
- Fix a Makefile find that removes zero length files, which fails                 
  on some systems.
- Web site update.
- Apply patch from Adam that fixes OpenBSD and FreeBSD pthreads 
  library bugs.
- Add poll time to SNMP driver, and correct header file prototyping.
- Make usb driver sleep for 1 second then retry up to 10 times
  if the device cannot be opened. There are two such loops so in
  the event of failure, it will occur 20 seconds later. This
  allows time for the hotplug program to initialize the USB devices
  after a boot.
