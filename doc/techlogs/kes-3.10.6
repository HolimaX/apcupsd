General:

Changes submitted this submission:
10Mar03
- Modify init script to use daemon so that STDIN/OUT, ... are   
  detached from the terminal and pointed to the log file. This
  prevents remotely logged in users who start apcupsd from being
  unable to log out.
06Mar03
- Made some mindor modifications to configure.in and aclocal.m4 to
  make consistent use of double quotes in test statements in
  response to problems with make install reported by Andrew Surratt.
- Thanks to Richard Schwaninger for finding and submitting a patch to
  the tcp-wrappers code that prevented it from working because of an
  invalid name. Fixed.
05Mar03
- Thanks to Andrew Reid for pointing out that the child reaping code
  should be clearing the pid slot if a -1 is returned. The pid table
  was filling up on his system due to killed children. Fixed
21Feb03
- A bug report against the Mandrake version of apcupsd indicates that
  apcupsd is not releasing /dev/console.  I've moved the close() of
  STDIN so that it is always executed to prevent this possibility.
12Feb03
- Implement very crude first cut of EEPROM programming in apctest.
  Set battery date, set UPS name, and print EEPROM values should
  work.
