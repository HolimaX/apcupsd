General:

Changes submitted this submission:
19Apr03
- Eliminate pow() function in linux-usb.c so that -lm is not needed.
14Apr03
- Add automatic detection of socklen_t
11Apr03
- I received a kernel patch from Sergey Vlasov that fixes
  the killpower problem on CS UPSes. apcupsd can now shutdown
  these devices! I've removed some debug code that was in
  the killpower routine and is not needed or used.
  I have put the kernel patch in:
    <apcupsd-source>/examples/linux-2.4.20-alt-hidups.patch
05Apr03
- When the Win32 version starts as a service, delete the
  NOLOGIN and PWRFAIL files to prevent later confusion.
  Thanks to Allen Crawford for pointing this out.
29Mar03
- Modify all Win32 program so that only windowed programs
  (apcupsd, popup) have the -mwindows flags. The others do not.
- Tweak apctest.c a bit -- add EEPROM programming (still a bit
  kludgy), but at least it can be done.
21Mar03
- Lots of clean ups for Cygwin stuff. Events now work, and exit.
- Clean up a few undefined symbols in building with everything on.
- Eliminate pid and serial port lock file on Win32 systems.
10Mar03
- Modify init script to use daemon so that STDIN/OUT, ... are   
  detached from the terminal and pointed to the log file. This
  prevents remotely logged in users who start apcupsd from being
  unable to log out.
06Mar03
- Made some mindor modifications to configure.in and aclocal.m4 to
  make consistent use of double quotes in test statements in
  response to problems with make install reported by Andrew Surratt.
- Thanks to Richard Schwaninger for finding and submitting a patch to
  the tcp-wrappers code that prevented it from working because of an
  invalid name. Fixed.
05Mar03
- Thanks to Andrew Reid for pointing out that the child reaping code
  should be clearing the pid slot if a -1 is returned. The pid table
  was filling up on his system due to killed children. Fixed
21Feb03
- A bug report against the Mandrake version of apcupsd indicates that
  apcupsd is not releasing /dev/console.  I've moved the close() of
  STDIN so that it is always executed to prevent this possibility.
12Feb03
- Implement very crude first cut of EEPROM programming in apctest.
  Set battery date, set UPS name, and print EEPROM values should
  work.
