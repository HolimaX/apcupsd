             Technical notes on version 3.11.0
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
26Nov05
- Update the version
- Cleanup errors in the uninstall script
- Remove a few MessageBoxes that annoy on Win98
- Set default UPSTYPE to apcsmart (was smartups)
- Add examples to installer script.
- Try to remove all files on uninstall.
- Add "missing" installer macro files.
- Implement NSIS installer. It can be downloaded from:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/  I'm using version
  2.0, but the latest one is 2.11
- Create winapcupsd.nsi.in file in src/win32 directory.
- Modify configure.in to generate winapcupsd.nsi file.
- Remove most of the old ServiceHelper code. It is not used,
  and creates problems on remote logins.
- Add nagios plugin contributed by Christian Masopust.
- Add all the new cygwin 1.5.18 binaries and the dll.
- Eliminate some compiler warnings.
- Make the old make binary-release work.
- Implement a new target for building the NSIS installer.
    ./configure (options...)
    make
    cd src/win32
    make winapcupsd.exe

26Jun05
- Correct compiler warnings in cgi for g++ 4.0
13Jun05
- Make /usr/share/man the default man directory.  
- Require C++ compiler and use full path.
12Jun05
- Renamed:
    apcdevice.c    device.c
    apcreports.c   reports.c
    apcaction.c    action.c
- Added set_replacebatt(value) and set_shutdownimm(value)
11Jun05
- Renamed:
    apc_defines.h  defines.h
    apc_struct.h   struct.h
    apc_drivers.h  drivers.h
    apc_nis.h      nis.h
    apc_extern.h   extern.h 
- Replace all old bit set/tests with methods. There are a
  few exceptions to this (multimon.c, ...) generally where
  status bits from the network are being examined.
06Jun05
- Implement trace to file with -T option.
- Convert all set/clear/test of Status to method accesses.
  There are some inconsistencies that must be resolved.
- Eliminate apc_version.h by combining it with version.h
01Jun05
- Get rid of old forking code.
- Start conversion of Status word to method accesses.
15May05
- Convert the core code to be compiled by C++. Most of it was already
  done.
- Modify the UPSINFO structure to be a class so that I can add class
  methods for accessing some of the variables (status bits).
05Apr05
- Move kes-3.10.17 to new 2005 directory (keeps techlogs cleaner).
