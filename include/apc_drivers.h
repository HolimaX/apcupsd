/*
 * This is the generic drivers structure. It contain any routine needed for
 * managing a device (or family of devices, like Smart UPSes).
 *
 * Routines defined:
 *
 * open()
 *   Opens the device and setup the file descriptor. Returns a working file
 *   descriptor. This function does not interact with hardware functionality.
 *   In case of error, this function does not return. It simply exit.
 *
 * setup()
 *   Setup the device for operations. This function interacts with hardware to
 *   make sure on the other end there is an UPS and that the link is working.
 *   In case of error, this function does not return. It simply exit.
 *
 * close()
 *   Closes the device returning it to the original status.
 *   This function always returns.
 *
 * kill_power()
 *   Kills the UPS power.
 *   This function always returns.
 *
 * read_ups_static_data()
 *   Gets the static data from UPS like the UPS name.
 *   This function always returns.
 *
 * read_ups_volatile_data()
 *   Fills UPSINFO with dynamic UPS data.
 *   This function always returns.
 *   This function must lock the UPSINFO structure.
 *
 * get_ups_capabilities()
 *   Try to understand what capabilities the UPS is able to perform.
 *   This function always returns.
 *
 * check_ups_state()
 *   Check if the UPS changed state.
 *   This function always returns.
 *   This function must lock the UPSINFO structure.
 *
 * ups_program_eeprom(ups, command, data)
 *   Commit changes to the internal UPS eeprom.
 *   This function performs the eeprom change command (using data),
 *     then returns.
 *
 * ups_generic_entry_point()
 *  This is a generic entry point into the drivers for specific driver
 *  functions called from inside the apcupsd core.
 *  This function always return.
 *  This function must lock the UPSINFO structure.
 *  This function gets a void * that contain data. This pointer can be used
 *  to pass data to the function or to get return values from the function,
 *  depending on the value of "command" and the general design of the specific
 *  command to be executed.
 *  Each driver will have its specific functions and will ignore any
 *  function that does not understand.
