 *   Fork to become a daemon
 *   write the shared memory
 *   start child process apcdev -- subroutine do_device()
 *   start child process apcnis, if configured -- subroutine do_server()
 *   wait for child processes to complete
 *   exit
 *
 * Child process apcdev -- subroutine do_device()
 *   wait for activity on serial port or timeout 
 *	  from select() (5 seconds) -- check_serial()
 *   call do_action()
 *	  read and lock the shared memory
 *	  check to see if UPS state has changed and if we should take any action. I.e.
 *		are we on batteries, should we shutdown, ...
 *	  write and unlock shared memory
 *   call fillUPS()
 *	  read and lock shared memory
 *	  Poll the UPS for each state variable
 *	  enable the UPS
 *	  enable the UPS again
 *	  write and unlock shared memory
 *   call do_reports()
 *	  if DATA report time expired, write DATA report -- log_data()
