GAPCMON (a.k.a gapcmon, and gpanel_apcmon)

	A Gtk2/GLib2 GUI application used to monitor UPS devices controlled
by the APCUPSD package.  These programs use the NIS interface from apcupsd to
collect event and status information for display to the end-user.  Because of
this great interface, this program can be executed on any OS supported machine
and use the network socket interface to connect back to apcupsd.  Of course
apcupsd must be compiled with nis support (i.e. ./configure --enable-nis ).

	Two programs are included for your use in the package; gapcmon is the 
regular gtk+ application, and a gnome panel applet version called gpanel_apcmon.


FEATURES: 

  gpanel_apcmon { only }
    * Support up to 8 UPSs from each applet (enabled from Preferences dialog).

  gpanel_apcmon and gapcmon { panel view or minimized view }
	* icon reflects state of monitored ups system 
		- where state is (online, onbattery, charging, not communicating)
	* icon tooltip or titlebar text displays a quick summary of the ups status.
	* background thread for all network io to keep user interface responsive.
	{gpanel_apcmon only}
	* right click pops panel menu with the About, Preferences dialogs, and the
	  remove-from-panel choices.
	* left-click toggles the displays main information window	
	
  gpanel_apcmon and gapcmon { the main information window }
	* notebook layout with four tabs:
		- History
			* Historical Line Graph tracking VAC, battery charge, batt voltage, 
			  ups load, and time remaining.  Data collection for this chart is
			  ten times the regular refresh time in seconds, and displays 40
			  collection cycles on screen. 
		- Information
			* more detailed view of apcupsd current state and ups current state
		- Events

			  apcupsd with NIS configured.

		- About {gapcmon only}
			* Program version and information panel

	Configure Source with 
	for gapcmon only : 
			'# ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-gpanel'
	for gpanel_apcmon only : 
			'# ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-gapcmon'
   	for all : 
    		'# ./configure --prefix=/usr'
    		
	Then compile with 'make clean all', then 'sudo make install'
	Binary RPM install with this command 'rpm -ivh gapcmon-{version}-{release}.i686.rpm'

	Both methods result in '/usr/bin/gapcmon', and '/usr/libexec/gpanel_apcmon' 
	being installed according to your system defaults for prefix.  
	Note: the configure step requires the parm 'prefix=/usr'.
