GAPCMON (a.k.a gapcmon, and gpanel_apcmon)

	A Gtk2/GLib2 GUI application used to monitor UPS devices controlled
by the APCUPSD package.  This program uses the NIS interface from apcupsd to
collect event and status information for display to the end-user.  Because of
this great interface, this program can be executed on any OS supported machine
and use the network socket interface to connect back to apcupsd.  Of course
apcupsd must be compiled with nis support (i.e. ./configure --enable-nis ).

	Two programs are included for your use in the package; gapcmon is the 
regular gtk+ application, and a gnome panel applet version called gapanel_apcmon.


FEATURES: 

  gpanel_apcmon & gapcmon

REQUIREMENTS:

	Gtk2/Glib-2.4 runtime support. (Created on Fedora Core 4)
	APCUPSD installed and configured to NIS support.
		{ apcupsd.sourceforge.net }

	* the following packages may need to be installed to build program and
	  for runtime of binaries on some platforms.

	gapcmon			{version 2.4 is minimum package level required}
		glib-devel  
		gtk-devel
		 
	gpanel_apcmon	{version 2.4 is minimum package level required}
		glib-devel 
		gtk-devel
		gnome-panel-devel
		

DISTRIBUTION METHOD:

	Source RPM	gapcmon-{version}-{release}.src.rpm
	Binary RPM	gapcmon-{version}-{release}.i686.rpm
	Source tar	gapcmon-{version}.tar.bz2

INSTALL INFO:
	Configure Source with 
		for gapcmon only : 
			'# ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-applet'
    	for gapcmon and gpanel_apcmon : 
    		'# ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-applet'
    		
	Then compile with 'make clean all', then 'sudo make install'
	Binary RPM install with this command 'rpm -ivh gapcmon-{version}-{release}.i686.rpm'

	Both method result in '/usr/bin/gapcmon' and/or '/usr/libexec/gpanel_apcmon' according to
	your system defaults for prefix.  Note: gpanel_apcmon requires 'prefix=/usr'.


INSTRUCTIONS: 

  gpanel_apcmon -- Gnome Panel Application 

	1. right click gnome desktop panel
	2. choose "Add to panel"
	3. Find "gpanel_apcmon ..." press add.
		- repeat for addition applets (i.e. if you have two ups, run two applets)
	4. left click applet icon to bring up info window.
		- select configure tab, enter hostname and port, choose refresh interval in seconds,
		  press apply (for only this instance), or save ( to save in config file for later)
	           
  gapcmon -- Gtk Application
    
    1. look in gnome menus for the "Application" group, then select "APCUPSD monitor"
    	- or enter '# gapcmon' on the command line.
    2. select configure tab, enter hostname and port, choose refresh interval in seconds,
	   press apply (for only this instance), or save ( to save in config file for later)
	3. optionally, use the command line syntax to configure.
		- syntax: '# gapcmon [--host dnsname | ipaddress ] [--port portnum] [--help]'
	

KNOWN BUGS:

	* The same executable is actively reused for each instance of the panel applet some
	  users have found it useful to run five or more instances.  If after a reboot you
	  find more applets icons running than normal or expected - kill the one program process
	  and re-add them to the panel.  
	           
	  example commands:
	  	- '# ps -ef | grep gpanel_apcmon'      -- locate pid number
	  	- '# kill pid'
