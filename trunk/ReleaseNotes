             Release Notes for Apcupsd 3.13.x

*DEVELOPMENT RELEASE*
3.13.6 22Jul06


NEW FEATURES

  * Mingw32-based win32 port
  
  * Windows USB support
  
  * Mac OS X Darwin USB support
  
  * Solaris 10 USB support

  * PowerChute Network Shutdown driver (--enable-pcnet)

  * GUI monitoring application, gapcmon , thanks to James Scott, Jr.
    This is a Gnome/GTK based application which integrates into most
    desktop panels (not just Gnome). The status of each UPS is shown
    with a icon similar to the Win32 tray icon in winapcupsd. Enable
    building of gapcmon at compile time via --enable-gapcmon.


NOTES

Windows Port (winapcupsd)
  * Must be installed at the root of a drive (C:\apcupsd, D:\apcupsd,
    etc.)

  * DEVICE specification for serial ports should be COM1, COM2, etc.

  * Other apcupsd.conf settings are identical to standard UNIX version.

  * Be sure to install USB driver if you have a USB UPS.


Mac OS X Darwin USB Support

  * To build you need gcc. I used gcc-4.0.1 from the recent 
    Developer Tools (XCode 2.2).

  * You need to install libusb-0.1.12 or later *before* building
    apcupsd. The build is very sensitive to the location of libusb.
    If you install it into a non-standard location (for your 
    platform), chances are good the compiler will be unable to
    find it.

  * Configure & build apcupsd:
  	./configure --enable-usb
  	make
  	sudo make install

  YOU MUST REBOOT AFTER INSTALLATION OF APCUPSD.

  * The 'make install' step will make a few necessary configuration 
    changes for you. Specifically, on Darwin it will install a dummy
    kext driver which prevents Apple's kernel drivers from exclusively
    opening APC UPSes.
    
  * apcupsd.conf should be edited as usual for usb conections:
	UPSCABLE usb
	UPSTYPE usb
	DEVICE


Solaris 10 USB Support

  * To build you need gcc. I used gcc-3.4.3 from the sfw package 
    distributed on the software suppliment CD (SUNWgcc, 
    SUNWgccruntime).

  * You need to install libusb (SUNWlibusb, SUNWlibusbugen) *before*
    building apcupsd. The build is very sensitive to the location of 
    libusb. If you install it into a non-standard location (for your 
    platform), chances are good the compiler will be unable to
    find it.

  * Configure & build apcupsd:
  	./configure --enable-usb
  	make
  	sudo make install


  * The 'make install' step will make a few necessary configuration 
    changes for you. On Solaris, 'make install' will add a driver 
    alias to map APC UPSes to the ugen driver

  YOU MUST RECONFIGURE BOOT ("reboot -- -r") AFTER INSTALLING APCUPSD.

  * apcupsd.conf should be edited as usual for usb conections:
	UPSCABLE usb
	UPSTYPE usb
	DEVICE


PowerChute Network Shutdown driver (pcnet)

  * This driver is an alternative to SNMP for use with APC's
    APC9617 family of network smartslot modules. It is a
    very new driver and likely buggy, so USE WITH CARE.

  * Configure and build with "./configure --enable-pcnet" to
    build the driver.

  * In apcupsd.conf set...

  	UPSCABLE ether
	UPSTYPE pcnet
	DEVICE ipaddr:user:passphrase

    ...where ipaddr is the IP address of the UPS mgmt card,
    user is the username you configured the card with (normally
    "apc") and passphrase is the password the card is configured
    with.

    Note that you may leave DEVICE blank and Apcupsd will accept
    information from any PCNET UPS on the network, HOWEVER IT
    WILL BE VERY INSECURE SINCE AN ATTACKER COULD EASILY SEND
    PACKETS CRAFTED TO CAUSE YOUR SERVER TO SHUT DOWN. Using 
    the ipaddr, user, and passphrase will prevent this behavior.
