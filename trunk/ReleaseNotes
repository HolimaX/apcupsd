          Release Notes for Apcupsd 3.10.6

General:
This is essentially a bug fix release but to avoid 
confusion, I have incremented the release number.

Changes since apcupsd 3.10.6
- Do automatic UPS detection in the USB code if no device is specified
  or if the specified device cannot be opened.
- Include patch provided by Howard Wilkinson, but put the new apcnet.c
  in apcnet.c.new until I have a chance to examine it in detail.

  His notes:
  I attach a complete rewrite of the Master side of the mast/slave code
  to support asynchronous connections to slaves.  I needed to do this as
  our network has a number of machines that tend to be powered off for
  long periods and the connect() calls were hanging around for more than
  nettime.
  I also, added a small patch for a new command line flag
  '-P|--pid-file' so that I can easily run multiple daemons on one
   machine.  I needed this as I have a machine that acts as a multiple
   master while getting its power from another UPS managed by another
   machine.
- Lib wrappers was not building correctly on FreeBSD due to the 
  library -lnls, so I copied over the Bacula code for configure.
  Thanks to Lars Köller for reporting this and for his patches.
- Attempt to get mkinstalldirs called by an absolute path rather
  than relative.
- Apply Lars' fixes to platforms/Makefile.in and platforms/etc/Makefile.in
  Install scripts with $(INSTALL_SCRIPT) instead of $(INSTALL_PROGRAM)
- Close all file descriptors except stdin/out/err.
- If there are no stdin/out/err (Windows), then create them and point them
  to /dev/null.  This prevents the serial port from suddenly getting
  debug output sent to it -- chaos.
- It seems that since the beginning of 3.10.x, the APCSMART_UPS never
  reported the proper status. This is because it was not in the case
  statement. Incredible since it is now the "standard" driver! Thanks
  to the user that brought this to my attention.
- Fix a segfault in linux-usb.c due to reference one beyond the command
  table. This happens only on newer USB UPSes. Thanks to the user who
  pointed this out.

Items to note:  !!!!!
