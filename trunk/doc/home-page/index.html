<H1>Apcupsd a daemon for controlling APC UPSes</H1>
<P><B>Apcupsd </B>can be used for power mangement and controlling most
of APC's UPS models on Unix and Windows machines. Apcupsd works with
most of APC's Smart-UPS models as well as most simple signalling models
such a Back-UPS, and BackUPS-Office. During a power failure,
<B>apcupsd</B> will inform the users about the power failure and that a
shutdown may occur. If power is not restored, a system shutdown will
follow when the battery is exhausted, a timeout (seconds) expires, or
runtime expires based on internal APC calculations determined by power
consumption rates. Apcupsd is licensed under the GPL version 2.

<h2>Other Software for Apcupsd</h2>
David Ranch has developed some very interesting graphing support for APC
UPSes, which works with <b>apcupsd</b>. Using <b>apcupsd's</b> logging
capabilities, David provides setup instructions and scripts to produce
high quality, daily PDF graphs of all the important UPS power conditions.

Apcupsd Hosted on Source Forge</a></h2>
We have moved the release of source and binaries (downloads) to Source
Forge for several reasons: 1. Lack of manpower to maintain several
sites, 2. The excellent Open Software Development services offered by
Source Forge. In addition to hosting all our new releases, the Source
Forge site has a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=54413">
CVS repository</a> where you can find the very latest development
software. Please visit it and become familiar with how it works.
<p>
If you wish to get a copy of the latest CVS code, you can do so
by doing:
<p>
<pre>  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@apcupsd.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/apcupsd login</pre>
(Press ENTER when prompted for a password)
<pre>  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@apcupsd.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/apcupsd co apcupsd</pre>
<p>
The above will put a copy of the current CVS into the directory named apcupsd
(better make sure it does not exist before issuing the command).
<p>
Thereafter to get the latest code, simply:
<pre>
  cd apcupsd
  cvs -z3 update -Pd
</pre>
