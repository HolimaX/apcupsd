<!-- The output encoding is UTF-8.  This is not because inputenc's UTF-8
     option is supporsed to be used, neither for the ucs package, but because
     the output LaTeX document contains a lot of control characters (see
     text-nodes.mod.xsl for details), and this is sent through tbrplent for
     substituting real LaTeX commands for all UTF-8 sequences.

     Please note that it may happen that a special package must be loaded for
     very rare characters.  If this is not done already you get an error
     message by LaTeX.  In this ase you have to load the package yoursef via
     the file texi2latex.cfg, that you have to provide in the current
     directory (or where LaTeX can find it).

     For efurther info see the documentation of texi2latex. -->

<!-- I don't know whether this is the default template anyway, but be that as

<!-- In itemizations it is bad to have the \par *before* the paragraph.  But

     this technique in tbook. -->
