<H1>Configuration Examples</H1>
<h2>A Simple Configuration</h2>
You have a Smart UPS using the cable supplied by APC.
A very simple configuration file would look like the following:
<pre>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ##
UPSCABLE smart
UPSTYPE smartups
DEVICE /dev/ttyS0
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS standalone
UPSMODE disable
</pre>
<p>Normally you would have many more configuration directives
to completely customize your installation, but this example
shows you the minimum required.</p>
<h2>A Simple Master Configuration</h2>
You have a Smart UPS using the cable supplied by APC and
you want it to act as a master for another computer, which
is powered by the same UPS.
A very simple configuration file would look like the following:
<pre>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ## 
UPSCABLE smart
UPSTYPE smartups
DEVICE /dev/ttyS0
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS netmaster
UPSMODE net
NETTIME 10
NETPORT 6666
SLAVE slave1.mynetwork.com
SLAVE slave2.mynetwork.com
</pre>
<p>Note, the main difference from the stand alone configuration si
that you have specified <b>UPSCLASS netmaster</b> and <b>UPSMODE net</b>.
In addition, you have specified one or more slave machines. </p>
<h2>A Simple Slave Configuration</h2>
You have a Smart UPS using the cable supplied by APC that
is connected to the master machine configured above. This
slave machine has no serial port connection to the UPS, but
is powered by the same UPS as the master.
A very simple configuration file would look like the following:
<pre>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ## 
UPSCABLE ether
UPSTYPE smartups
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS netslave
UPSMODE net
NETPORT 6666
MASTER master.mynetwork.com
</pre>
<p>The main difference from the master configuration is that you
have specified <b>UPSCABLE ether</b> and <b>UPSCLASS netslave</b>. 
In addition, you have specified a single controlling master.</p>
In this configuration, the shutdown will be initiated by the
master. It is also possible to specify BATTERYLEVEL, MINUTES,
and TIMEOUT configuration directives in the Slave machine that
will cause the slave to shutdown before the master. This can
often be useful if the slave is less important than the master
and you wish to reduce battery power consumption so that the
master can remain up longer during a power outage.
<h2>Variation on the Master/Slave Configuration</h2>
It is also possible to have a Master/Slave configuration where
the Slave is powered by a different UPS (or any other power 
source), but is nevertheless controlled (i.e. shutdown) by
the master. The setup would be identical to the Master/Slave
configuration files shown above. The only difference is where
the slave actually receives its power. In effect, <b>apcupsd</b>
does not know or care where the power really comes from.
