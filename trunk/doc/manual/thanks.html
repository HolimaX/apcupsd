<p>Thanks to American Power Conversion (APC) who helped
in giving technical information on their UPSes.
<p>A special thanks to APC who gave me (Riccardo) a Smart UPS&nbsp;1400 INET when my old
Back UPS v/s 650's battery died. Thank you guys, your help has been invaluable.
<p>Thanks to all the users that send bug reports and suggestions:&nbsp;we
need your help.
<p>Thanks to every one I&nbsp;forgot here. If you feel I&nbsp;have
forgot your name, please don't hesitate to tell me.
