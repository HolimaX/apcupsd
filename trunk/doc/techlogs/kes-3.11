             Technical notes on version 3.11.0
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
12Jun05
- Renamed:
    apcdevice.c    device.c
    apcreports.c   reports.c
    apcaction.c    action.c
- Added set_replacebatt(value) and set_shutdownimm(value)
11Jun05
- Renamed:
    apc_defines.h  defines.h
    apc_struct.h   struct.h
    apc_drivers.h  drivers.h
    apc_nis.h      nis.h
    apc_extern.h   extern.h 
- Replace all old bit set/tests with methods. There are a
  few exceptions to this (multimon.c, ...) generally where
  status bits from the network are being examined.
06Jun05
- Implement trace to file with -T option.
- Convert all set/clear/test of Status to method accesses.
  There are some inconsistencies that must be resolved.
- Eliminate apc_version.h by combining it with version.h
01Jun05
- Get rid of old forking code.
- Start conversion of Status word to method accesses.
15May05
- Convert the core code to be compiled by C++. Most of it was already
  done.
- Modify the UPSINFO structure to be a class so that I can add class
  methods for accessing some of the variables (status bits).
05Apr05
- Move kes-3.10.17 to new 2005 directory (keeps techlogs cleaner).
