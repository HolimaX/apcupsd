             Technical notes on version 3.11.0
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
01Jun05
- Get rid of old forking code.
- Start conversion of Status word to method accesses.
15May05
- Convert the core code to be compiled by C++. Most of it was already
  done.
- Modify the UPSINFO structure to be a class so that I can add class
  methods for accessing some of the variables (status bits).
05Apr05
- Move kes-3.10.17 to new 2005 directory (keeps techlogs cleaner).
