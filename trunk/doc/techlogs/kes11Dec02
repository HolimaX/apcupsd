General:
- Tried to correct problems with Makefiles

Changes submitted this submission:
- Removed Makefile code that creates and sets permission bits on
  /tmp $(prefix) and $(exec-prefix)
- Removed all occurrences of -z in the Makefiles (at least that I
  found) and replaced them with a more conservative formulation.
- Removed the install-symlinks script that caused some problems
  on distributions with blanks in the DISTVER name.
- Added install-symlinks to the suse Makefile.in. This is the
  only platform that currently uses it.
