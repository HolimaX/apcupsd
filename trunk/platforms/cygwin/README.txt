
             apcupsd-3.8.0 Win32


This is the binary distribution of apcupsd for Win32
systems (Win95, Win98 and WinNT, and possibly Win2000).

INSTALLATION

1. From InstallShield Setup

Run the Setup program and follow the instructions.
Be careful in following these guidelines:

  1.1 You can select the Setup type

  1.2 Don't change the default installation directory:
      it must be c:\apcupsd or the program will not work.
      We've been very careful to avoid root directory
      pollution.

  1.3 In the last dialog you will be asked to run a program.
      It is needed to register apcupsd inside the system
      registry. Please run it. If you choose not to run it
      you can always run the setup.bat program later from the
      apcupsd installation directory but until you do it,
      apcupsd will not work.

2. From TAR Archive

To install it, please UnZip (or detar) the distribution
file into your root directory on drive c:\  then follow
the instructions in the online manual viewable by any
Internet Browser (Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer).
The manual can be found in c:\apcupsd\manual.
