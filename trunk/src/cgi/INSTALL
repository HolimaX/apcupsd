Here's how to install things..

1. Edit the Makefile and check CGIPATH.  The default value should
   be acceptable for RedHat 5.x systems.  If you want something in a 
   different place, edit things to suit your system.

2. Edit upsfetch.c and check the #define for STATFILE suits your
   installation of apcupsd.

3. Edit upsstats.c and change the #define for REFRESH if you want 
   the page to refresh at a different interval (default: 30 secs).

3. make

4. su (if necessary)

5. make install
