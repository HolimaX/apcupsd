 * In principle I should not need to define dummy functions to link a
 * program against libapc.a and libdrivers.a
 * The fact that I need this means that we have forward references from
 * the libraries back into the main programs.
 *
 * The main programs are, by definition, non stand-alone programs,
 * that need libapc it is perfectly understandabe that to link apcupsd
 * we need libapc.a and libdrivers.a
 *
 * But it's much less understandable that to link
 *
 * main() { /* dummy */ }
 * 
 * against libapc.a and libdrivers.a I need to define the following dummy
 * functions.
 *
 * There is something that needs careful review in how we handle border-line
 * situations like shutdown of the daemon, cleanup of lock files, close
 * log files etc etc.
 *
 * To say the least, it's courios that to link the following simple program
 * against libapc.a and libdrivers.a I needed to define these dummies.
 *
 * To say the most, it's crazy :-)
